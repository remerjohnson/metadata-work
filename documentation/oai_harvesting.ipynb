Often in academic research studies the goals for informatics teams are to build applications that provide extract-transform-load (ETL) functionality to archive and catalog source data that has been collected by the research teams. In consortia that cross species and methodological or scientific domains, building interfaces which supply data in a usable fashion and make intuitive sense to scientists from dramatically different backgrounds increases the complexity for developers. Further, reusing source data from outside one’s scientific domain is fraught with ambiguities in understanding the data types, analysis methodologies, and how to combine the data with those from other research teams. We report on the design, implementation, and performance of a semantic data management application to support the NIMH funded Conte Center at the University of California, Irvine. The Center is testing a theory of the consequences of “fragmented” (unpredictable, high entropy) early-life experiences on adolescent cognitive and emotional outcomes in both humans and rodents. It employs cross-species neuroimaging, epigenomic, molecular, and neuroanatomical approaches in humans and rodents to assess the potential consequences of fragmented unpredictable experience on brain structure and circuitry. To address this multi-technology, multi-species approach, the system uses semantic web techniques based on the Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) to facilitate data ETL functionality. We find this approach enables a low-cost, easy to maintain, and semantically meaningful information management system, enabling the diverse research teams to access and use the data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-09-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-045</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-045</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 45</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-045/717</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-045/718</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-045/693</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-045/694</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-045/695</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-045</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-045</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Consultative research data management support from Data Services in the University Libraries played an integral role in the development of the training curriculum. Emphasizing the importance of data quality to the field workers at the beginning of this training curriculum was a vital part of its success. Also critical for success was the research group’s investment of time and effort to work with field workers and improve data management systems. We compare this case study to three others in the literature to compare and contrast data management processes and procedures. This case study serves as one example of how targeted training and efforts in data and project management for a research project can lead to substantial improvements in research data quality.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-09-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-043</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-043</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 43</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-043/886</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-043/887</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-043/1803</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-043</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-043</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The data mining clustering technique can be used to accomplish this customer segmentation. This technique clusters the customers in such a way that the customers in one group behave similarly when compared to the customers in other groups. The customer related data are categorical in nature. However, the clustering algorithms for categorical data are few and are unable to handle uncertainty. Rough set theory (RST) is a mathematical approach that handles uncertainty and is capable of discovering knowledge from a database. This paper proposes a new clustering technique called MADO (Minimum Average Dissimilarity between Objects) for categorical data based on elements of RST. The proposed algorithm is compared with other RST based clustering algorithms, such as MMR (Min-Min Roughness), MMeR (Min Mean Roughness), SDR (Standard Deviation Roughness), SSDR (Standard deviation of Standard Deviation Roughness), and MADE (Maximal Attributes DEpendency). The results show that for the real customer data considered, the MADO algorithm achieves clusters with higher cohesion, lower coupling, and less computational complexity when compared to the above mentioned algorithms. The proposed algorithm has also been tested on a synthetic data set to prove that it is also suitable for high dimensional data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-04-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-019</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.13-019</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 1-11</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-019/1</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.13-019</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

A Current Research Information System (CRIS) that conforms to the standard CERIF (Common European Research Information Format) could be a key component in the e-infrastructure. A CRIS provides the structure and makes it possible to interoperate the CRIS metadata at every stage of the research cycle.

Since the digital age, many specialised and generic persistent identifier (PID) systems have been used to identify digital objects. Just as many ancient indexes have died over time, so too PID systems have had a lifecycle from inception to active phase to paralysis, and eventually a fall into oblivion. Where the indexes within the Great Library at Alexandria finally succumbed to fire, technology change has been the destroyer of more recent digital indexes.We distil four PID system design principles from observations over the years that we think should be implemented by PID system architects to ensure that their systems survive change. The principles: describe how to ensure identifiers’ system and organisation independence; codify the delivery of essential PID system functions; mandate a separation of PID functions from data delivery mechanisms; and require generation of policies detailing how change is handled.In addition to suggesting specific items for each principle, we propose that a platform-independent model (PIM) be established for persistent identifiers – of any sort and with any resolver technology – in order to enable transition between present and future systems and the preservation of the identifiers’ functioning. We detail our PID system—the PID Service—that implements the proposed principles and a data model to some extent and we describe an implementation case study of an organisation’s implementation of PID systems that implement the Pillars further but still not completely.Penultimately, we describe in a Future Work section, an opportunity for the use of both the Pillars and the PIM; that of the World Wide Web Consortium’s Permanent Identifier Community Group who is seeking to “set up and maintain a secure permanent, URL re-direction service for the web”.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-013</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-013</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 13</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-013/650</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-013/651</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-013</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-013</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">630BC - present</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In such an innovative space, this study investigated the change dynamics, system thinking, and adaptive design strategies associated with the IIHCC evolution and libraries’ innovation. It employed a mixed-methods approach combining semi-structured interviews, ethnographic participant observation, and document analysis. The results present an emerging horizon of intelligent infrastructure and ubiquitous mobility and the evolving knowledge space and shifting data sphere in this cyber-physical-human integrated environment. Within such developments, this study discusses the developing scenarios of “smart” libraries as innovative testbeds for data exploration, community knowledge base, and intelligent information interface. It further projects an intelligent, learning, and adaptive library system, featuring exemplary data science platform and dynamic data management mechanism, smart design and innovation space, as well as collective intelligence and creative partnership. During this extraordinary time of horizon change, this timely work informs academic library transformation and its architectural innovation in the age of “smartness.”</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-03-21</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-011</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-011</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 11</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-011/821</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-011/822</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-011/1485</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-011/1486</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-011</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-011</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">human subjects</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The interest is motivated by a need to support research activities through data sharing and collaboration both locally and internationally. Many institutions, especially in the developed countries, have implemented RDM services to accelerate research and innovation through e-Research but extensive RDM is not so common in developing countries. In reality many African universities and research institutions are yet to implement the most basic of data management services. We believe that the absence of political will and national government mandates on data management often hold back the development and implementation of RDM services. Similarly, research funding agencies are not yet applying sufficient pressure to ensure that Africa complies with the requirement to deposit research data in trusted repositories. While the context was acknowledged the University of Dodoma library staff realized that it is urgent to prepare for the inevitable – the time when RDM will be a requirement for research funding support.This paper presents the results of research conducted at the University of Dodoma, Tanzania. The purpose of the research was to identify and report on relevant RDM services that need to be implemented so that researchers and university management could collaborate and make our research data accessible to the international community.This paper presents findings on important issues for consideration when planning to develop and implement RDM services at a developing country academic institution. The paper also mentions the requirements for the sustainability of these initiatives.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-01-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-001</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-001</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 1</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-001/925</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-001/926</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-001/1333</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-001/1909</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-001</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-001</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The system needs to store not only numerical data but also the formulae that operate on the data. It needs also the logical software that enables the system to find and combine together data and formulae to solve problems. It is shown that this logical software is similar to the backward-chaining algorithm used in expert systems with factual data. It has been successfully tested on a large number of problems, including many taken from textbooks in physics and chemistry and some taken from practical problems in engineering, including problems that need the solution of simultaneous equations, and including a novel solution to the problem of choosing the optimum material for a component. It has an interface based on the well known symbols used in equations; it can work with any system of units and it can check the accuracy of the calculations. The principle can be used in any numerical database that contains data which can be manipulated using formulae, not just in the physical sciences.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.182</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.3.182</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 3 (2004); 182-190</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.182/290</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.3.182</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The representation of the 3D structure of DNA allows biologists to observe and analyze genomes in an interactive way at different levels. We developed a powerful software platform that provides a new point of view for sequences analysis: ADN-Viewer. Nevertheless, a classical eukaryotic chromosome of 40 million base pairs requires about 6 Gbytes of 3D data. In order to manage these huge amounts of data in real-time, we designed various scene management algorithms and immersive human-computer interaction for user-friendly data exploration.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.82</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.4.82</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 4 (2005); 82-91</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.82/373</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.4.82</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has outlined the importance of information for improving health for all. However, financial resources remain limited. Health costs represent 11% of GNP in France, Germany, Switzerland and Canada, 14% in the USA, and 7.5% in Spain and the United Kingdom. Governments, local powers, health or insurance organizations therefore face difficult choices in terms of opportunities and priorities, and for that they need specific and valuable data. Firstly, this paper provide a comprehensive overview of our networked society and the appointment of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) and Health (in other words e-Health) in a perspective of needs and uses at the micro, meso, and macro levels. We point out the main challenges of development of Nationwide Health Information Network both in the US, UK and France. Then we analyze the main issues about data for Decision Making in Networked Health: coordination and evaluation. In the last sections, we use an Information System perspective to investigate the three interoperability layers (micro, meso and macro). We analyze the requirements and challenges to design an interoperability global architecture which supports different kinds of interactions; then we focus on the harmonization efforts provided at several levels. Finally, we identify common methodological and engineering issues.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-06-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.64</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.64</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 64-78</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.64/454</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.64</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Although there are clear benefits to data sharing, there is at least one field where this norm has yet to be developed: the behavioural sciences. In this paper, we propose an innovative methodology as a means to change existing norms within the behavioural sciences and move towards increased data sharing. Based on recent advances in social psychology, we theorize that a Survey Research Instrument that takes into account basic psychological processes can be effective in promoting data sharing norms.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2012-03-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.11-DS4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.11-DS4</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 11 (2012): Special Issue; DS29-DS43</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

With research data, data policy should also serve the broader goals of advancing scientific and scholarly inquiry and society at large. This is especially true with government-funded data, which likely comprise the vast majority of research data. Data policy should address multiple issues, depending on the nature and objectives of the data. These issues include data access requirements, data preservation and stewardship requirements, standards and compliance mechanisms, data security issues, privacy and ethical concerns, and potentially even specific collection protocols and defined data flows. The specifics of different policies can vary dramatically, but all data policies need to address data access and preservation. Research data gain value with use and must therefore be accessible and preserved for future access. This article focuses on data access. While policy might address multiple issues, at a first level it must address where the data stand on what Lyon (2009) calls the continuum of openness. Making data as openly accessible as possible provides the greatest societal benefit, and a central purpose of data policy is to work toward ethically open data access. An open data regime not only maximizes the benefit of the data, it also simplifies most of the other issues around effective research data stewardship and infrastructure development.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-07-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-008</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-008</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; GRDI43-GRDI50</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-008/224</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-008</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

A method of enhancing the compression efficiency of the common JPEG standard is presented in this paper, exploiting the Burrows-Wheeler compression technique. The paper suggests a replacement of the traditional Huffman compression used by JPEG by the Burrows-Wheeler compression. When using high quality images, this replacement will yield a better compression ratio. If the image is synthetic, even a poor quality image can be compressed better.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-27</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.19</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.19</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); 19-27</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.19/341</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.19</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Network theory is applied to a preliminary inventory of polar and global data management actors to improve understanding of the emerging community of practice. Under the name the Arctic Data Coordination Network, we propose a model network that can support the community in achieving their goals through improving connectivity between existing actors.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-10-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-16</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-16</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014): Special Issue; PDA94-PDA102</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-16/33</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-16</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The data tiers consist of several distributive data servers that are located in each CAS institute and support such unstructured data formats as vector files, remote sensing images or other raster files, documents, multi-media files, tables, and other format files. For the spatial data files, format transformation service is provided. The middle tier involves a centralized metadata server, which stores metadata records of data on all data servers. The primary function of this tier is catalog service, supporting the creation, search, browsing, updating, and deletion of catalogs. The client tier involves an integrated client that provides the end-users interfaces to search, browse, and download data or create a catalog and upload data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-26</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S770</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S770</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S770-S778</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S770/496</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S770</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Partially due to these science drivers, it is common for disciplinary data systems to expand from their original scope in order to accommodate collaborative research. The result is multiple disparate databases with overlapping but incompatible data. In order to enable more complete data integration and analysis, the Observations Data Model Version 2 (ODM2) was developed to be a general information model, with one of its major goals to integrate data collected by in situ sensors with those by ex-situ analyses of field specimens. Four use cases with different science drivers and disciplines have adopted ODM2 because of benefits to their users. The disciplines behind the four cases are diverse – hydrology, rock geochemistry, soil geochemistry, and biogeochemistry. For each case, we outline the benefits, challenges, and rationale for adopting ODM2. In each case, the decision to implement ODM2 was made to increase interoperability and expand data and metadata capabilities. One of the common benefits was the ability to use the flexible handling and comprehensive description of specimens and data collection sites in ODM2’s sampling feature concept. We also summarize best practices for implementing ODM2 based on the experience of these initial adopters. The descriptions here should help other potential adopters of ODM2 implement their own instances or to modify ODM2 to suit their needs.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-02-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-004</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-004</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 4</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-004/626</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-004/629</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-004/154</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-004/155</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-004/443</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-004/444</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-004/445</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-004</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-004</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We describe additions to a collection prepared for use in paleoclimate state estimation, specifically the Last Millennium Reanalysis (LMR). The 2290 additional series include 2152 tree ring chronologies and 138 other series. They supplement the collection used previously and together form a database titled LMRdb 1.0.0. The additional data draws from lake core, ice core, coral, speleothem, and tree ring archives, using published data primarily from the NOAA Paleoclimatology archive and a set of tree ring width chronologies standardized from raw International Tree Ring Data Bank ring width series. In contrast to many previous paleo compilations, the data were not selected (screened) on the basis of their environmental correlation, multi-century length, or other attributes. The inclusion of proxies sensitive to moisture and other environmental variables expands their use in data assimilation. A preliminary calibration using linear regression with mean annual temperature reveals characteristics of the proxy series and their relationship to temperature, as well as the noise and error characteristics of the records. The additional records are structured as individual files in the NOAA Paleoclimatology format and archived at NOAA Paleoclimatology (Anderson et al. 2018) and will continue to be improved and expanded as part of the LMR Project. The additions represent a four-fold increase in the number of records available for assimilation, provide expanded geographic coverage, and add additional proxy variables. Applications include data assimilation, proxy system model development, and paleoclimate reconstruction using climate field reconstruction and other methods.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-01-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-002</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-002</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 2</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-002/803</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-002/804</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1132</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1133</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1134</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1136</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1307</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1308</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1309</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1310</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1311</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-002</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-002</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">global</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">last millennium, instrumental period</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

They employ technologies that generate increasingly large ‘omic’ datasets and research teams regularly include experts ranging from animal care technicians, veterinarians, human health clinicians, geneticists, immunologists, and biochemists to computer scientists, mathematical modelers, and data scientists, often located at different institutions. Providing the cyberinfrastructure support framework (IT, data management, communication, documentation, and aspects of project management related to these areas) for these projects requires a diverse set of technical tools and soft skills. These skills must be able to meet both the broad needs of data generators and consumers within the project and the needs of the larger scientific community. Here we describe recommendations for cyberinfrastructure support teams responsible for systems biology research programs. Recommendations are based on lessons learned while establishing and leading a complex, transdisciplinary, host-pathogen malaria systems biology consortium involving many institutions, a variety of disciplines, animal infectious disease models, and clinical studies. While some technical suggestions are included, the primary foci are situational and sociological challenges and tips for handling them.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-06-09</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-024</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-024</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 24</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-024/972</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-024/973</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-024/2119</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-024/2120</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-024/2429</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-024/2430</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-024/2431</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-024</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-024</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Second, an algorithm for similar data retrieval is introduced.

However, researchers and academics must still work in a restrictive copyright environment within Europe. This paper reviews the Directive in the light of two recent UK reports that suggest a more liberal copyright regime is both culturally and economically desirable. The author suggests that unfair competition problems should be addressed by new unfair competition laws for Ireland and the UK and not through revision of the Directive.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-06-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.OD12</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.OD12</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007): Special Issue; OD12-OD20</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.OD12/364</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.OD12</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

That incident was associated with the so-called \"black foot disease.\" In the late 1970s and early 1980s, arsenic specific coetaneous changes were diagnosed in the Xinjiang Autonomous Rregion and subsequently in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shanxi Province. Recently, endemic arsenicosis was also found in Jilin, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Anhui Provinces. The prevalence of arsenicosis in China is becoming more and more serious. In order to prevent and control it, many departments and institutes have begun to work in this field. They have made a great progress including also the sharing of arsenicosis data within a limited area. But the limited nature of this data sharing is a barrier for preventing and controlling arsenicosis. Only once data sharing is realized within the whole nation, can we discover the best way of eliminating arsenicosis. With this goal in mind, we have set up a rudimentary platform of asenicosis data sharing. This gradually needs to be improved and improved.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-09-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S511</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S511</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S511-S517</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S511/445</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S511</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

GOSIC manages an online portal providing an entry point for users of climate-related global observing systems data and information systems and also helps serve the needs of the World Data Center for Meteorology, Asheville. The GOSIC continues to evolve and expand its responsibilities, and this paper is an update to a similar paper (Diamond &amp;amp; Lief, 2009) that was presented at the 1st ICSU World Data System Conference in Kyoto, Japan in September 2011. Since 2009, there have been considerable updates made to the GOSIC portal that will be discussed in the paper.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-01-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-002</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-002</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS13-WDS16</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-002/55</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-002</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The spatio-temporal classes are based upon GeoToolKit, an object-oriented 3D/4D geodatabase kernel system. Range queries on spatio-temporal objects are described in detail. We demonstrate the application of the spatio-temporal model with the balanced restoration of structural Rhine Basin evolution, an ambitious geological application.

By reason of its mandate, vision, and strategic positioning, NRC-CISTI has been rapidly and effectively mobilizing Canadian stakeholders and resources to become a lead player on both the Canadian national and international scenes in matters relating to the organization and management of scientific research data. In a previous communication (CODATA International Conference, 2008), the orientation of NRC-CISTI towards this objective and its short- and medium-term plans and strategies were presented. Since then, significant milestones have been achieved. This paper presents NRC-CISTI's most recent activities in these areas, which are progressing well alongside a strategic organizational redesign process that is realigning NRC-CISTI's structure, mission, and mandate to better serve its clients. Throughout this transformational phase, activities relating to data management remain vibrant.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-01-13</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.009-026</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.009-026</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010); 100-106</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.009-026/132</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.009-026</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In answer, governments have started to establish many systems to provide the public with scientific data. However, sometimes the access does not consider the public's practical need but just stands as an \"official\" prototype. In this research, a questionnaire was devised to understand a Beijing citizen's practical need for scientific data and to explore the inconsistency between the needs of the public and the information published by the government. The research looks to find a more effective way to solve this problem.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-05-18</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S297</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S297</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S297-S300</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S297/413</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S297</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

By querying the metadata database, researchers are able to access data file/information held by data facilities. Moreover, by utilizing our analysis software, users can download, visualize, and analyze upper-atmospheric data archived in or linked with the system.

This study has revealed that recent environmental change in the Nigerian coastal region has been much more apparent than that of a few years back (1989-2007). Various kinds of ocean debris, transported mainly by coastal wind, are severely affecting the marine and coastal environment. Because the current ocean monitoring system has been found to be troubled by ocean debris, establishing a new system to obtain reliable observational data to monitor and preserve the environment of the coastal region is urgent.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-03-14</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-022</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj.WDS-022</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS129-WDS133</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-022/101</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj.WDS-022</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

After two centuries of hydrate research, a great amount of scientific data on gas hydrates has been accumulated. Therefore the means to manage, share, and exchange these data have become an urgent task. At present, metadata (Markup Language) is recognized as one of the most efficient ways to facilitate data management, storage, integration, exchange, discovery and retrieval. Therefore the CODATA Gas Hydrate Data Task Group proposed and specified Gas Hydrate Markup Language (GHML) as an extensible conceptual metadata model to characterize the features of data on gas hydrate.

However, today’s scientists do not only produce traditional research papers – they produce comprehensive digital resources and collections. TIB’s mission is to develop a supportive framework for a sustainable access to such digital content – focusing on areas of engineering as well as architecture, chemistry, information technology, mathematics and physics. The term digital content comprises all digitally available resources such as audiovisual media, databases, texts, images, spreadsheets, digital lab journals, multimedia, 3D objects, statistics and software code.In executing this mission, TIB provides services for the management of digital content during ongoing and for finished research. This includes: - a technical and administrative infrastructure for indexing, cataloguing, DOI registration and licensing for text and digital objects, namely the TIB DOI registration which is active since 2005, - the administration of the ORCID DE consortium, an institutional network fostering the adoption of ORCID across academic institutions in Germany, - training and consultancy for data management, complemented with a digital repository for the deposition and provision of accessible, traceable and citable research data (RADAR), - a Research and Development Department where innovative projects focus on the visualization and the sustainable access to digital information, and - the development of a supportive framework within the German research data community which accompanies the life cycle of scientific knowledge generation and transfer. Its goal is to harmonize (meta)data display and exchange primarily on a national level (LEIBNIZ DATA project).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-07-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-036</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-036</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 36</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-036/699</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-036/700</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-036/265</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-036</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-036</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Such resources are now primarily provided through High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities. As a result of a global increase in availability and accessibility of supercomputing HPC facilities, numerical models that can now be employed have become more complex. Furthermore, resolutions now used and achievable have increased significantly.The Southern African Development Community (SADC) Cyber-Infrastructure (CI) Framework aims to build increased capacity in regional research and education networks, data sharing infrastructure and trained human capital – to make efficient and effective use of the CI resources. Through the implementation of the regional CI framework and national initiatives, several member states in Southern Africa now have HPC facilities. The availability of this infrastructure in the region provides opportunities for domains, domain scientists and collaboration through research and development projects. For meteorology, this will support more local and regional weather and climate scientists. For meteorological services, this will mean increased in-house and in-country capacity to run models, with less reliance on external resources from developed countries. This paper discusses a regional weather and climate implementation project of the SADC CI.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-07-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-034</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-034</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 34</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-034/867</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-034/868</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1446</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1447</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1448</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1449</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1450</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1495</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1725</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1726</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1727</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1728</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1729</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1730</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1731</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1732</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1771</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-034</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-034</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Emerging institutional and international environmental initiatives, like the ESA and EC Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), require access to full historical data collections, including the performed data elaborations, scientific analysis, models and results. The historical ESA Earth Observation archives account for Petabytes data holding, which is augmented, since the launch of Envisat in 2002, by some 500 Terabytes per year. The access and utilisation of these archives is an important measurement for long-term data preservation; improving it is a continuous challenge at programmatic, technological and operational level. This article describes how Digital Library and Grid technology can support the underlying infrastructure for long-term data preservation.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.222</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.3.222</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 3 (2004): Special Issue; 222-226</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.222/305</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.3.222</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

They build models, representations, and other various mediating structures that are thought to be good constructions. In doing this, humans are engaged in a process of cognitive niche construction. More precisely, we argue that a cognitive niche emerges from a network of continuous interplay between individuals and environment, in which people alter and modify the environment by mimetically externalizing fleeting thoughts, private ideas, etc., into external supports. This can turn out to be useful, especially for all those situations that require information transmission, shared knowledge, and more generally, cognitive resources.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S87</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S87</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S87-S91</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S87/387</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S87</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Approximate field matching is the key solution to resolve the problem by identifying semantically equivalent string values in syntactically different representations. This paper considers token-based solutions and proposes a general field matching framework to generalize the field matching problem in different domains. By introducing a concept of String Matching Points (SMP) in string comparison, string matching accuracy and efficiency are improved, compared with other commonly-applied field matching algorithms. The paper discusses the development of field matching algorithms from the developed general framework. The framework and corresponding algorithm are tested on a public data set of the NASA publication abstract database. The approach can be applied to address the similar problems in other databases.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-11-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.127</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.127</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 127-142</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.127/468</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.127</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, there is a shortage of spontaneous speech corpora that are freely available for academics. We therefore undertook the building of a natural conversation speech database, recording over 200 hours of conversations in English by over 600 local university students. With few exceptions, the students used their own cell phones from their own rooms or homes to speak to one another, and they were permitted to speak on any topic they chose. Although they knew that they were being recorded and that they would receive a small payment, their conversations in the corpus are probably very close to being natural and spontaneous. This paper describes a detailed case study of the problems we faced and the methods we used to make the recordings and control the collection of these social science data on a limited budget.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-11-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.10-011</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.10-011</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); 42-51</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.10-011/74</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.10-011</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Algebraic expressions, consisting of simple and multiple merged chains of binary relations, are stated in SQL syntax-based object queries, which are utilized by a multiwavefront algorithm mapped on a multi-directional multi-functional engine(M2FE), for object oriented parallel query processing. The proposed extension also attempts to solve other object oriented database issues, such as inheritance, relationships between objects and literals, and recursive queries.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.121</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.121</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); 121-136</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.121/355</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.121</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Major problems discussed were the lack of scalable applications, the lack of expertise in developing solutions, the lack of respect for or attention to big data problems, data volume growth exceeding Moore's Law, poorly scaling algorithms, and poor data quality and integration. More communication between users, developers, and researchers is sorely needed. A variety of future work to help all three groups was discussed, ranging from collecting challenge problems to connecting with particular industrial or academic sectors.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2012-03-18</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.012-010</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.012-010</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 11 (2012); 37-45</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.012-010/47</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.012-010</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Materials science image data is an important class of non-structured data. This paper proposes a semantic annotation method to resolve the problem of materials science image data sharing. This method is implemented by a four-layer architecture, which includes ontology building, semantic annotation, reasoning service, and application. We take metallographic image data as an example and build a metallographic image OWL-ontology. Users can accomplish semantic annotation of metallographic image according to the ontology. Reasoning service is provided in a data sharing application to demonstrate the effective sharing of materials science image data through adding semantic annotation.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-04-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-042</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.007-042</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 52-61</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-042/206</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.007-042</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper, waiting time, crowded time, and driving time between different bus stations on different bus routes at different times of the day are calculated from bus IC cards data history. Then, a multi-objective program with various constraints is suggested to recommend comfortable bus routes for bus passengers, and a genetic algorithm is developed to search for expected solutions. The proposed method is implemented using bus IC cards data from Chongqing, China and will be a promising tool for bus passengers when choosing comfortable bus routes.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-014</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-014</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 14</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-014/557</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-014/558</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-014</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-014</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Recent regulations, mandates, policies, and guidelines set forth by the U.S. government, federal other, and funding agencies, scientific societies and scholarly publishers, have levied stewardship requirements on digital scientific data. This elevated level of requirements has increased the need for a formal approach to stewardship activities that supports compliance verification and reporting. Meeting or verifying compliance with stewardship requirements requires assessing the current state, identifying gaps, and, if necessary, defining a roadmap for improvement. This, however, touches on standards and best practices in multiple knowledge domains. Therefore, data stewardship practitioners, especially these at data repositories or data service centers or associated with data stewardship programs, can benefit from knowledge of existing maturity assessment models. This article provides an overview of the current state of assessing stewardship maturity for federally funded digital scientific data. A brief description of existing maturity assessment models and related application(s) is provided. This helps stewardship practitioners to readily obtain basic information about these models. It allows them to evaluate each model’s suitability for their unique verification and improvement needs.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-03-26</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-007</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-007</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 7</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-007/745</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-007/746</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-007/832</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-007/833</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-007/925</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-007</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-007</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">N/A</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">N/A</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The extensive nature of the collection and the diverse and often remote nature of the source locations means that the cost of recreating the collection, if possible, would be $AU100Ms. The original samples were collected as part of either extensive government geological mapping programs or more specific scientific expeditions conducted for major Government initiatives. They are technically open to anyone (industry, educational institutions, the public), but are essentially unknown and almost impossible to access.Management of this collection was based on an aged card catalogue and ledger system developed in the pre-digital era. The aged management system, with increasing deterioration of the physical media, combined with loss of access to even some of the original contributors meant that rescue work was needed. Rescuing the collection made use of non-traditional means, including the extensive use of web-based citizen science and reference to a small number of onsite volunteers.Through essentially a volunteer effort, from a group more used to biology related items, the project has seen the transcription of some 40,000 sample metadata records (more than 2.5 times our current electronic holdings). This paper examines the process undertaken and advocates the approach that has made it successful. It promotes the value and benefits to Geoscience Australia, participating volunteers and potential users of the collection.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-11-14</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-057</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-057</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 57</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-057/914</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-057/916</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1599</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1600</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1601</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1602</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1603</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1604</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1605</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1606</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1607</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1608</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1609</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1610</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1611</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1612</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1613</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1614</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1615</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1616</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1617</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1910</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-057</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-057</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Australia, Antarctic</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The representation and management of this knowledge becomes the key point to ensure the proper functioning of the system and to keep an intuitive view upon its expected behavior. This paper presents a generic architecture for implementing knowledge-base systems used in collaborative businesses, where the knowledge is organized into different databases, according to the usage, persistence, and quality of the information. This approach is illustrated with Cadral, a customizable automated tool built on this architecture and used for processing family benefits applications at the National Family Benefits Fund of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-04-26</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S225</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S225</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S225-S233</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S225/405</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S225</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Understanding what users may, or may not, do with data in online data repositories is key to maximizing the benefits of scientific data re-use. Many online repositories that allow access to scientific data indicate that data is “open,” yet specific usage conditions reviewed on 40 “open” sites suggest that there is no agreed upon understanding of what “open” means with respect to data. This inconsistency can be an impediment to data re-use by researchers and the public.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-01-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-043</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-043</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 203-230</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-043/15</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-043</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The database information comes from major areas of the world, especially the countries adjacent to China, and updates are done continuously. The Sinology Database is in several different languages and should satisfy the differing needs of data collection and database application. The data quality is strictly controlled during the whole data life cycle, which includes data collection, processing, storage, and accessing. In addition, according to the standards and specifications of the metadata, metadata are created to accompany the data, which satisfies the cooperation among different databases. Finally, besides the function of searching, statistical calculation, and sorting, the database is also used for data mining and knowledge discovery. Through these methods, conclusions about changes in Sinology can be drawn, which will aid us in understanding the world and China in particular.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S930</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S930</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S930-S940</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S930/519</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S930</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The agency responses have generated discussion and interest but are yet to be analyzed and compared. In this paper, we examine how 19 federal agencies responded to the memo, written by John Holdren, on issues of scientific data and the extent of their compliance to the directives outlined in the memo. We present a varied picture of the readiness of federal science agencies to comply with the memo through a comparative analysis and close reading of the contents of these responses. While some agencies, particularly those with a long history of supporting and conducting science, scored well, other responses indicate that some agencies have only taken a few steps towards implementing policies that comply with the memo. These results are of interest to the data curation community as they reveal how different agencies across the federal government approach their responsibilities for research data management, and how new policies and requirements might continue to affect scientists and research communities.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-06-14</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-027</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-027</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 27</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-027/680</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-027/681</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-027</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-027</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

With the evolvement from database to big data, the schema matching has been enriched with various purposes and application contexts, ranging from data integration, to service integration, to semantic data clouding, until more recent exploratory data analysis over big data. These enriched contexts increase the demand for schema matching between semantic data-types, such as XML, RDF etc.The existing integration approaches have not dealt with the challenges of defining a relation between XML and other semantic data-types. To address these challenges, this paper studies the problem of schema mapping from XML to RDF in two folds. Firstly, testify the validity of single matcher in a column based manner for the semantic data types. Secondly, testify the validity of a highly configurable framework that utilizes hierarchical classification in order to construct a composable pipeline.We propose and implement a Reconfigurable pipeline for Semi-Automatic Schema Matching (REPSASM), which aims to solve the customizability of the matching problem by providing an environment in which a user can create, configure and experiment with their own schema-matching procedure.The experiments performed within this work show that the configurability and hierarchical classification improves the matching result, and it proposes an algorithm to automatically optimize such a hierarchy pipeline.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-06-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-025</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-025</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 25</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-025/849</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-025/850</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1519</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1520</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1521</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1522</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1523</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1524</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1525</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1526</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1527</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1528</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-025</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-025</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It aims at breaking the limitation of diachronic language attributed to the process of history cognition, summation, and recovery, addressing a possible scheme to fuse historical factors in relation to changing history, dynamically applying a multiplicity of results so that the discipline of world history can meet the needs of the information-equipped society of the 21st century.

The purpose of this project was to research and implement a system of stable identification for the texts and linguistic data objects in Coptic SCRIPTORIUM to facilitate their citation and reuse. We began the project with a preferred solution, the Canonical Text Services URN model, which we validated for suitability for the corpus and compared it to other approaches, including HTTP URLs and Handles. The process of applying the CTS model to Coptic SCRIPTORIUM required an in-depth analysis that took into account the domain-specific scholarly research and citation practices, the structure of the textual data, and the data management workflow.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-11-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-013</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2016-013</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 13</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-013/608</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-013/609</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-013/156</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-013</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-013</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The knowledge about Germany’s federal system, which also entails the autonomy of the federal states regarding the higher education system, is fundamental to understand the different approaches towards RDM in Germany. The state initiatives of Thuringia, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Hesse are described to compare them to the state initiative (Landesinitiative NFDI) of Germany’s most populous state of North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW). The aim of the initiative in NRW is to initiate the collaboration between institutions, to link current RDM activities in NRW and to prepare the local institutions for the participation in a National Research Data Infrastructure (Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur, NFDI).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-10-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-025</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-025</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 25</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-025/781</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-025/782</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-025</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-025</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In recent times the FAIR principles became a prominent role as framework for the sustainability of scientific data. Both approaches had always machine actionability, the capability of computational systems to use services on data without human intervention, in their focus. The more technical approach of digital objects turned out to provide a complementary view on several aspects of the policy framework of FAIR from a technical perspective. After a deeper analysis and integration of these concepts by a group of European data experts the discussion intensified on so called FAIR digital objects. But they need to be accompanied by services as building blocks for automated processes. We will describe the components of this framework and its potentials here, and also which services inside this framework are required.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-04-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-015</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-015</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 15</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-015/956</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-015/957</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-015/2139</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-015/2140</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-015</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-015</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Supported by The Chinese Academy of Science and The Ministry of Science and Technology, our center has made much progress in recent years. The center has not only established the database to restore data which contain heat flow data, geomagnetic data, gravity data, etc. but also put them on the Internet (http://gp.wdc.cn) to provide free data service. The center has expended a great deal of effort to rescue the magnetograms observed 100 years ago by the Sheshan Observatory, the earliest geomagnetic observatory in China. The geophysics data of our center are abundant, and the way to get the data and information from the website is very simple and easily obtainable. In the future, the center will edit more data and construct a strong, convenient database in order to provide the better service to users.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-07-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S404</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S404</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S404-S407</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S404/427</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S404</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The system is based on the University of Minnesota MapServer, an open source platform for publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web with MySQL as the backend database server. This paper discusses some of the details of the storage and organization of oceanographic data, methods employed for visualization of parameter plots, and mapping of the data. ODIS is conceived to be an end-to-end system comprising acquisition of data from a variety of heterogeneous ocean platforms, processing, integration, quality control, and web-based dissemination to users for operational and research activities. ODIS provides efficient data management and potential mapping and visualization functions for oceanographic data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-08-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-005</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.13-005</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013); 47-55</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-005/38</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.13-005</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It was found that; 1) there was obvious prenoon-postnoon asymmetry of SqH in summer and equinox; 2) in summer, equinox, and winter, the averaged foci of Sq were located at 27° N, 29° N, and 35° N, respectively. However, in a single quiet day, the Sq foci might reach a latitude north of 50° N and south of 19° N; 3). There were some inconsistencies in the behavior of the SqH distributions in two longitudinal chains, such as the reverse of SqH variations in the same latitudinal chain and the increase (decrease) of the daily ranges from east to west. All these demonstrated that there might be latitudinal migration of the Sq focus or changes in current intensity during the longitudinal migration of the Sq focus from east to west.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-07-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-26</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-26</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); IAGA183-IAGA191</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

One of the activity is the provision of seasonal and medium-range climate forecasts to enable decisions concerning livestock herding. Seasonal weather forecasts are critical but there are challenges of timeliness and usability of the forecasts. The challenges are associated with the multiplicity of information sources, methods for data integration and dissemination channels. Institutions including public and Civil Society Organizations usually invest in collecting weather and other data which should be accessible. Often times this data remains hoarded necessitating other organizations to collect similar data. The inter-institutional relations notwithstanding, the lack of data sharing leads to minimal data available for open access. This paper illustrates that this challenge can be addressed by using combined multiple methods to elicit data on weather and other biophysical conditions for pastoralism in Karamoja. In this paper we additionally analyse the opportunities and challenges of using multiple sources of pastoral-relevant data to couple with weather information in support of herding decisions. Building resilient pastoralism that utilizes pasture and water availability will have to utilize available data. It is evident that more robust approaches for data sharing at global, regional and local levels are needed to understand how pastoralists can respond to climate shocks and changes. The paper illustrates the use of a multifaceted-methods approach including open data to develop climate forecast information for risk-reduction oriented information for decision-making. Integration of this data provides insights on how pastoralists have long adapted to a variable and changing climate, the methods and processes of adaptation to losses and damages from the climate shocks.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-11-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-050</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-050</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 50</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-050/727</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-050/728</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/428</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/429</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/740</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/741</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/742</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/743</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/744</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/745</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-050</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-050</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Sub-region of Northeastern Uganda</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Strengthening international data sharing networks will not only demand advancing technical, legal, and logistical infrastructure for publishing data in open, accessible formats; it will also require recognizing, respecting, and learning to work across diverse data cultures. This essay introduces a heuristic for pursuing richer characterizations of the “data cultures” at play in international, interdisciplinary data sharing. The heuristic prompts cultural analysts to query the contexts of data sharing for a particular discipline, institution, geography, or project at seven scales – the meta, macro, meso, micro, techno, data, and nano. The essay articulates examples of the diverse cultural forces acting upon and interacting with researchers in different communities at each scale. The heuristic we introduce in this essay aims to elicit from researchers the beliefs, values, practices, incentives, and restrictions that impact how they think about and approach data sharing – not in an effort to iron out differences between disciplines, but instead to showcase and affirm the diversity of traditions and modes of analysis that have shaped how data gets collected, organized, and interpreted in diverse settings.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-09-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-048</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-048</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 48</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-048/896</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-048/897</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-048/1778</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-048/1863</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-048</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-048</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This bias was of the order 10° and persisted from November 2008 to January 2010, which was consistent with a post-recovery calibration drift in the anemometer vane. Unfortunately, the calibration drift was too time-variant to be used to correct the data so the quality flag for this deployment was adjusted to reflect low data quality. The primary purpose of this paper is to inform users in the modelling and remote-sensing community about this systematic, persistent wind directional bias, which will allow users to make an educated decision on using the data and be aware of its potential impact to their downstream product quality. The uncovering of this bias and its source demonstrates the importance of continuous scientific oversight and effective user-data provider communication in stewarding scientific data. It also suggests the need for improvement in the ability of buoy data quality control procedures of the TAO and ECMWF systems to detect future wind directional systematic biases such as the one described here.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-07-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-019</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-019</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 79-87</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-019/6</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-019</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Geomagnetic variation data measured with a fluxgate magnetometer are not absolute but are relative to a baseline and show drift. To enhance the importance of the geomagnetic data at Syowa Station, therefore, it is necessary to correct the continuous variation data by using absolute baseline values acquired by a magnetic theodolite and proton magnetometer. However, the database of baseline values contains outliers. We detected outliers in the database and then converted the geomagnetic variation data to absolute values by using the reliable baseline values.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-05-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-044</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-044</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS243-WDS246</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-044/164</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-044</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The data was collected in an efficient and systematic way by long-term experiments and observations of black land and statistics information. It is based on the ORACLE database management system and the interface is written in PB language. The database has the following main facilities:(1) runs on Windows platforms; (2) facilitates data entry from *.dbf to ORACLE or creates ORACLE tables directly; (3)has a metadata facility that describes the methods used in the laboratory or in the observations; (4) data can be transferred to an expert system for simulation analysis and estimates made by Visual C++ and Visual Basic; (5) can be connected with GIS, so it is easy to analyze changes in land use ; and (6) allows metadata and data entity to be shared on the internet. The following datasets are included in CSDB_BL: long-term experiments and observations of water, soil, climate, biology, special research projects, and a natural resource survey of Hailun County in the 1980s; images from remote sensing, graphs of vectors and grids, and statistics from Northeast of China. CSDB_BL can be used in the research and evaluation of agricultural sustainability nationally, regionally, or locally. Also, it can be used as a tool to assist the government in planning for agricultural development. Expert systems connected with CSDB_BL can give farmers directions for farm planting management.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-12</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S867</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S867</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S867-S878</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S867/510</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S867</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Policies concerning the open access to research data try to implement new norms calling for researchers to make their data more openly available. These policies either appeal to the common good or focus on publication and citation as an incentive to bring about a cultural change in how researchers share their data with their peers. But when we compare the total number of publications in the fields of science, technology and medicine with the number data publications from the same time period, the number of openly available datasets is rather small. This indicates that current policies on data sharing are not effective in changing behaviours and bringing about the wanted cultural change. By looking at research communities that are more open to data sharing we can study the social patterns that influence data sharing and point us to possible points for intervention and change.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-014</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-014</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 14</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-014/652</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-014/653</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-014</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-014</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, conventional ESN predictions require a large volume of training samples. Meanwhile, the time sequence data are complicated and unstable, resulting in insufficient learning of this network and difficult training. As a result, the accuracies of conventional ESN predictions are limited. Aimed at this issue, a time series prediction model of Grey Wolf optimized ESN has been proposed. Wout of ESN was optimized using the Grey Wolf algorithm and predictions of time series data were achieved using simplified training. The results indicated that the optimized time series prediction method exhibits superior prediction accuracy at a small sample size, compared with conventional prediction methods.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-05-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-016</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-016</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 16</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-016/831</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-016/832</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1019</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1020</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1021</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1022</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1023</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1024</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1025</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1026</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-016</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-016</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

There are currently many different methods in use for optimizing digital objects for research purposes. These methods have been applied to many scientific disciplines but differ in architecture and approach. The goals of this joint digital research object (DRO) conference were to discuss the challenge of characterizing DROs at scale in volume and over time and possible organizing principles that might connect current DRO architectures. One of the primary challenges concerns convincing scientists that these tools and practices will actually make the research process easier and more fruitful. This conference included work from CENDI, the National Federal STI Managers Group, the National Federation of Advanced Information Services (NFAIS), the Research Data Alliance (RDA), and the National Academy of Science (NAS).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-06-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-016</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-016</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 16</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-016/763</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-016/764</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-016</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-016</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

GCW fosters international coordination and partnerships with the goal of providing authoritative, clear and usable data, information and analyses on the past, current and future state of the cryosphere. It fosters sustained and mutually beneficial partnerships between research and operational institutions, by linking research and operations as well as scientists and practitioners. This is important as most available cryospheric data come from the scientific community. It is generally managed by research institutes which often do not have the infrastructure, the resources, nor the mandate to enable FAIR data management, which is necessary for interoperability and discovery at data level. This implies that data do not fit into standardized systems or dataflows for broader data access and exchange (as exists at the WMO) and thus have been unavailable for operational meteorological and climate applications. This lack of standardization also impairs the reuse of data within the scientific community. GCW is bridging this gap through a data portal and software stack enabling the transformation of sparsely documented and highly variable data into standardized and well documented data suitable for downstream applications with data level interoperability. A processing engine converts raw data provided by the data producers into NetCDF-CF standard files with NetCDF Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) metadata. The data portal web front end harvests the metadata necessary for its search engine through an OPeNDAP server so no manual editing of the medatadata is necessary. When a user downloads some data from the web portal, it gets the requested data through the OPeNDAP server.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\">European Union’s Horizon 2020</dc:contributor><dc:date>2020-02-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-006</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-006</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 6</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-006/935</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-006/936</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2097</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2098</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2099</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2100</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2101</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2102</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2103</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2107</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2108</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2109</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2251</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2252</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2253</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2254</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-006</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-006</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Natural Resources and Ecology GIS Database sponsored by the Council of Agriculture, which is part of the National Geographic Information System planned by the Ministry of Interior, was the most well established biodiversity database in Taiwan. But thisThis database was, however, mainly collectingcollected the distribution data of terrestrial animals and plants within the Taiwan area. In 2001, GBIF was formed, and Taiwan joined as one of the an Associate Participant and started, starting the establishment and integration of animal and plant species databases; therefore, TaiBIF was able to co-operate with GBIF. The information of Catalog of Life, specimens, and alien species were integrated by the Darwin core. The standard. These metadata standards allowed the biodiversity information of Taiwan to connect with global databases.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S2</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S2-S10</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S2/378</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S2</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

With the speed-up of globalization, wider adoption of computers and advanced communication technologies, and more frequent academic exchanges and co-operation, collaborative research across organizations, regions, and fields has provided greater access to Chinese researchers in the humanities and social sciences. Accordingly, co-authored papers have witnessed considerable growth in number and proportion. The Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;amp;HCI), published by the Institute for Scientific Information (USA), enjoy a high reputation worldwide as large-scale and comprehensive retrieval systems for international large comprehensive papers and citations. This article aims to reveal the trends of Chinese collaborative research in the humanities and social sciences from the perspective of bibliometrics and offer advice for Chinese researchers and managers in these fields, by analyzing Chinese co-authored papers in the humanities and social sciences indexed in the SSCI and A&amp;amp;HCI in the last decade (1995-2004).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S571</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S571</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S571-S580</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S571/459</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S571</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

To this end a digital object should be associated with metadata appropriate for interpreting that object; such metadata are often referred as representation information. Even such metadata may not be intelligible, however, so we may have to associate them with extra metadata, and so on. This paper approaches this problem by introducing an abstract model comprising modules and dependencies. Community knowledge is formalized over the same model by introducing the notion of profile. This notion is then exploited for deciding representation information adequacy (during input) and intelligibility (during output). Subsequently some general dependency management services for identifying and filling intelligibility gaps during input and output are described and analysed. Finally a prototype system based on these ideas is described.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-05-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-071</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.007-071</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 139-151</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-071/229</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.007-071</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Finally, the ERF (European Research Facilities) consortium representing national facilities with international access was formed to parallel EIROForum (the European laboratories funded by international subscriptions). It is becoming increasingly clear that management of these facilities and management of the research process require extensive ICT: for research managers that is provided by CRIS (Current Research Information Systems) and to give researchers additionally access to facilities to control experiments with associated modelling and simulation and access to research datasets and software.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2010-04-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.CRIS6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.CRIS6</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010): Special Issue; CRIS39-CRIS43</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.CRIS6/155</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.CRIS6</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this research field, among others, there is a need for an integrated use of social science survey data and spatial science data, e.g. for combining demographic information from survey data with data on pollution from spatial data. However, for researchers it is challenging to link both data sources, because (1) the interdisciplinary nature of both data sources is different, (2) both underlie different legal restrictions, in particular regarding data privacy, and (3) methodological challenges arise regarding the use of geo-information systems (GIS) for the processing and analysis of spatial data.In this article, we present an infrastructure of distributed web services which supports researchers in the process of spatial linking. The infrastructure addresses the challenges researchers have to face during that process. We present an example case study on the investigation of environmental inequalities with regards to income and land use hazards in Germany by using georeferenced survey data of the GESIS Panel and the German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP), and by using spatial data from the Monitor of Settlement and Open Space Development (IOER Monitor). The results show that increasing income of survey respondents is associated with less exposure to land-use-related environmental hazards in Germany.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-07-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-027</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-027</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 27</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-027/978</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-027/979</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/1850</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/1851</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/1852</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/1853</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/1854</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/2360</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-027</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-027</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The potential contributions of such data to the creation of new knowledge and downstream economic and social goods can in many cases be multiplied exponentially when the data are made openly available on digital networks. Most developed countries spend large amounts of public resources on research and related scientific facilities and instruments that generate massive amounts of data. Yet precious little of that investment is devoted to promoting the value of the resulting data by preserving and making them broadly available. The largely ad hoc approach to managing such data, however, is now beginning to be understood as inadequate to meet the exigencies of the national and international research enterprise. The time has thus come for the research community to establish explicit responsibilities for these digital resources. This article reviews the opportunities and challenges to the global science system associated with establishing an open data policy.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-06-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.OD36</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.OD36</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007): Special Issue; OD36-OD53</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.OD36/367</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.OD36</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Sixty children of three age groups (8-, 9- and 11-year-old groups) participated in the experiment. Each group included 10 girls and 10 boys. Stimuli were presented in two separate lists: semantic priming list and mental arithmetic list. Participants were instructed to decide whether the target word was a real Chinese character or not in semantic priming task and decide whether the production of the arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication) was correct or false in mental arithmetic task. The main new observation was that the cognitive process reflected by major ERP components changes with the age growing up. In the lexical decision task, the amplitude of N400 elicited by semantic non-related target was significantly larger than that of a related target in all the children groups. The latency and amplitude of N400 component in 8-year-old group were larger than that of 11-year-old group. A similar RP component was elicited by either a Chinese single-character word or pseudo-word as reported by other authors. In mental arithmetic task, similar results were observed that the latencies of P2, N2, P3 in 8-year-group were longer than those of the 11-year-old group. These was no significant differences in amplitude across the three operation and age groups. These results suggest that semantic priming effects and mental arithmetic are developmental processes even in the early childhood. These two cognitive processes may be used to evaluate the development of language and arithmetic abilities.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-09-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S535</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S535</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S535-S547</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S535/448</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S535</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In 2000 CODATA (Committee on Data for Science and Technology, International Council for Science) established a task group for Data on Natural Gas Hydrates, which aims to develop a comprehensive information system of all aspects of natural gas hydrates. As important participants of this task group, Chinese scientists have constructed a gas hydrate information system in China. Now they are developing the data-based research support system of gas hydrates based on the existing gas hydrate information system. In this paper, the authors introduce the idea of constructing a data-based research support system of gas hydrates in detail, including the high level framework design of constructing this system, system platform and functions, and database designs. We believe this system will definitely facilitate the data sharing and scientific research of gas hydrates.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-06-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.GH37</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.GH37</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007): Special Issue; GH37-GH43</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.GH37/529</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.GH37</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this article, we present a framework for persistent identification that fundamentally supports context information. It is installed as a number of low-level requirements and abstract data type descriptions, flexible enough to envelope context information while remaining compatible with existing definitions and infrastructures. The abstract data type definitions we draw from the requirements and exemplary use cases can act as an evaluation tool for existing implementations or as a blueprint for future persistent identification infrastructures. A prototypic implementation based on the Handle System is briefly introduced. We also lay the groundwork for establishing a graph of persistent entities that can act as a base layer for more sophisticated information schemas to preserve context information.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-03-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12-036</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.12-036</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013); 10-22</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12-036/35</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.12-036</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

An ontology grounded in description logics was developed based on the ISO 15926 data model to describe three types of sustainability science conceptualizations: situational knowledge, analytic methods, and scenario frameworks. Semantic statements were then created using this ontology to describe expert knowledge expressed in research proposals and papers related to sustainability science and in scenarios for achieving sustainable societies. Semantic matching based on logic and rule-based inference was used to quantify the conceptual overlap of semantic statements, which shows the semantic similarity of topics studied by different researchers in sustainability science, similarities that might be unknown to the researchers themselves.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-01-13</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.Kraines</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.Kraines</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010); 107-123</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.Kraines/135</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.Kraines</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper various techniques are studied and tried, such as XSL transformations (XSLT) and ways of extending the contents of XML Schemas, the final aim being in creating an understanding of the possibilities, and a roadmap that could possibly lead to some useful real-world applications. Based on a materials database an XML Schema is specified that defines the structure of an XML document capable of representing quite complex materials test data together with mandatory metadata. Some approaches are discussed and some of them implemented in prototypes to study the possibilities to comply with and use MatML in order to support sharing of experimentally measured materials data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-03-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.179</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.7.179</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 7 (2008); 179-195</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.179/335</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.7.179</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Large amounts of data are generated in the MEA distributed and heterogeneous environment. As the demand for intelligent engineering information applications increases, the challenge is to effectively organize these complex data and provide timely and accurate on-demand services. In this paper, based on the supporting environment of Open Cloud Services Architecture (OCSA) and Virtual DataSpace (VDS), a new semantic-driven knowledge representation model for MEA information is proposed. Faced with the MEA constantly changing user requirements, this model elaborates the semantic representation of data, services and their relationships to support the construction of domain knowledge ontology. Then, based on the ontology modeling in VDS, the semantic representations of association mapping, rule-based reasoning, and evolution tracking are analyzed to support MEA knowledge acquisition. Finally, an application example of knowledge representation in the field of materials engineering is given to illustrate the proposed model, and some experimental comparisons are discussed for evaluating and verifying the effectiveness of this method.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-04-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-061</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.13-061</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 26-44</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-061/3</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.13-061</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The goal of the project was to provide the construction professionals with an on-line aid for component specification and selection at different levels of the construction life cycle. This two years project started in 1997 and involved several partners. This paper describes the main features of the information system: databases, query and communication systems. SYDOX(SYstème de DOnnées compleXes) is aimed at defining and demonstrating a prototype to access information about MATerials and COMPonents used in construction, implemented on a WWW server. Though the objective is general, the work was focused on a restricted sub-section of the construction domain. We describe the domain and the scope of the project, the starting point and the lessons learnt from the development of the prototype. We also propose some important ideas on which this research is based.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.1.257</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.1.257</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 1, No 2 (2002); 257-270</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.1.257/185</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.1.257</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Scholars increasingly use scientific and cultural assets in digital form, but choosing which among many objects to cite for the long term can be difficult. There are few well-defined terms to describe the various kinds and qualities of persistence that object repositories and identifier resolvers do or don’t provide. Given an object’s identifier, one should be able to query a provider to retrieve human- and machine-readable information to help judge the level of service to expect and help gauge whether the identifier is durable enough, as a sort of long-term bet, to include in a citation. The vocabulary should enable providers to articulate persistence policies and set user expectations.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-08-14</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-039</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-039</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 39</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-039/705</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-039/706</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-039</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-039</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Therefore, we propose a framework called Cyber Integrated Medical Infrastructure (CIMI). Within this framework, we can deal with various types of data and consequently need to integrate those data prior to analysis. In this study, for medical science, we analyze the features and relationships among various types of data and show the possibility of integrated data mining.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S104</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S104</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S104-S115</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S104/390</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S104</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, no single model can perform the best for all kinds of merchandise. Accurate prediction results for just one commodity are meaningless to sellers. A general prediction for all commodities is needed. This paper illustrates a novel trigger system that can match certain kinds of commodities with a prediction model to give better prediction results for different kinds of commodities. We find some related factors for classification. Several classical prediction models are included as basic models for classification. We compared the results of the trigger model with other single models. The results show that the accuracy of the trigger model is better than that of a single model. This has implications for business in that sellers can utilize the proposed system to effectively predict the sales of several commodities.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-015</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-015</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 15</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-015/574</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-015/576</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-015</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-015</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The main objective of this research is to quantify uncertainties about impacts of malaria on mortality. A multivariate spatial regression model was developed for estimation of the risk of mortality associated with malaria across Ogun State in Nigeria, West Africa. We characterize different local governments in the data and model the spatial structure of the mortality data in infants and pregnant women. A flexible Bayesian hierarchical model was considered for a space-time series of counts (mortality) by constructing a likelihood-based version of a generalized Poisson regression model that combines methods for point-level misaligned data and change of support regression. A simple two-stage procedure for producing maps of predicted risk is described. Logistic regression modeling was used to determine an approximate risk on a larger scale, and geo-statistical (\"Kriging\") approaches were used to improve prediction at a local level. The results suggest improvement of risk prediction brought about in the second stage. The advantages and shortcomings of this approach highlight the need for further development of a better analytical methodology.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.145</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.145</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); 145-153</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.145/358</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.145</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Named the WONM (Wide-area Observation Network Monitoring) system, it enables data acquisition, transfer, and storage through connection to the NICT Science Cloud, and has been supplied to observatories for supporting space-weather forecast and research. This system provides us with easier management of data collection than our previously employed systems by means of autonomous system recovery, periodical state monitoring, and dynamic warning procedures. Operation of the WONM system is introduced in this report.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-10-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-09</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-09</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014): Special Issue; PDA51-PDA56</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-09/26</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-09</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The largest transactional databases and data warehouses can no longer be hosted cost-effectively in off-the-shelf commercial database management systems. There are other forums for discussing databases and data warehouses, but they typically deal with problems occurring at smaller scales and do not always focus on practical solutions or influencing DBMS vendors. Given the relatively small (but highly influential and growing) number of users with these databases and the relatively small number of opportunities to exchange practical information related to DBMSes at extremely large scale, a workshop on extremely large databases was organized. This paper is the final report of the discussions and activities at the workshop.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2008-02-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.7.1</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 7 (2008); 1-13</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.1/293</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.7.1</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The documents and metadata for the data are insufficient. The scientific data service is dated. The data application procedure is troublesome, etc. All this has become a bottleneck affecting the progress of China's scientific data sharing. Considering the reality of China, some potential solution have been proposed, which include changing the scheme of data integration, perfecting metadata and documentation, emphasizing data service, simplifying the application procedure, enhancing the shared consciousness in science and technology fields, establishing national data centers, and realizing sustainable data sharing.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-05-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S250</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S250</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S250-S254</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S250/407</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S250</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The currently best available global public domain product covers only one-quarter to one-third of the existing road networks, and this varies considerably by region. Applications for such a data set span multiple sectors and would be particularly valuable for the international economic development, disaster relief, and biodiversity conservation communities, not to mention national and regional agencies and organizations around the world. The building blocks for such a global product are available for many countries and regions, yet thus far there has been neither strategy nor leadership for developing it. This paper evaluates the best available public domain and commercial data sets, assesses the gaps in global coverage, and proposes a number of strategies for filling them. It also identifies stakeholder organizations with an interest in such a data set that might either provide leadership or funding for its development. It closes with a proposed set of actions to begin the process.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-12-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.223</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.223</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 223-265</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.223/488</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.223</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

On the other hand, the scientific climate community requests early citations on evolving data for credit, e.g. for CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6). The data citation concept for CMIP6 is presented. The main challenges lie in limited resources, a strict project timeline and the dependency on changes of the data dissemination infrastructure ESGF (Earth System Grid Federation) to meet the data citation requirements. Therefore a pragmatic, flexible and extendible approach for the CMIP6 data citation service was developed, consisting of a citation for the full evolving data superset and a data cart approach for citing the concrete used data subset. This two citation approach can be implemented according to the RDA recommendations for evolving data. Because of resource constraints and missing project policies, the implementation of the second part of the citation concept is postponed to CMIP7. </dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-06-15</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-030</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-030</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 30</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-030/686</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-030/687</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-030/261</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-030/262</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-030/263</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-030/264</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-030</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-030</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This is due to increased demands by governments and other funding agencies to have research data archived and shared as widely as possible. This paper sought to establish the data sharing practices of researchers in South Africa. The study further sought to establish the level of collaboration among researchers in sharing research data at the university level. The outcomes of the survey will help the researchers to develop appropriate data literacy awareness programmes meant to stimulate growth in data sharing practices for the benefit of research, not only in South Africa, but the world at large. A survey research method was used to gather data from willing public universities in South Africa. A similar study was conducted in other countries such as the United Kingdom, France and Turkey but the Researchers believe that circumstances in the developed world may differ with the South African research environment, hence the current study. The major finding of this study was that most researchers preferred to use data produced by others but less keen on sharing their own data. This study is the first of its kind in South Africa which investigates data sharing practices of researchers from multi-disciplinary fields at the university level and will contribute immensely to the growing body of literature in the area of research data management.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-07-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-028</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-028</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 28</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-028/855</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-028/856</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-028</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-028</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

First, the formal expert’s opinions are more fully expressed, and this is realized with the more complex measures of activity (the concept of straightenings (Gvishiani et al. 2003; Gvishiani et al. 2004; Zlotnicki et al. 2005) is replaced by the measures of activity which come to the fore): second, for the junction of anomalies, a recently created DPS (Discrete Perfect Sets) algorithm is used

The strategic initiative EnviDat highlights the importance WSL lays on Research Data Management (RDM) at the institutional level and demonstrates the commitment to accessible research data in order to advance environmental science.EnviDat focuses on registering and publishing environmental data sets and provides unified and efficient access to the WSL’s comprehensive reservoir of environmental monitoring and research data. Research data management is organized in a decentralized manner where the responsibility to curate research data remains with the experts and the original data providers.EnviDat supports data producers and data users in registration, documentation, storage, publication, search and retrieval of a wide range of heterogeneous data sets from the environmental domain. Innovative features include (i) a flexible, three-layer metadata schema, (ii) an additive data discovery model that considers spatial data and (iii) a DataCRediT mechanism designed for specifying data authorship. In addition, the overall user-friendly appearance in EnviDat provides an important opportunity for showcasing WSL research activities and results. The EnviDat portal builds on a conceptual system consisting of a core system, a set of guiding principles and a number of key services. Its development closely follows the conceptual framework, being guided by principles towards the ultimate goal of providing useful services for researchers.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-10-18</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-028</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-028</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 28</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-028/787</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-028/788</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1096</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1097</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1098</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1099</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1100</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1101</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1102</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1230</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-028</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-028</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Given the importance of instruments and associated metadata to the assessment of data quality and data reuse, globally unique, persistent and resolvable identification of instruments is crucial. The Research Data Alliance Working Group Persistent Identification of Instruments (PIDINST) developed a community-driven solution for persistent identification of instruments which we present and discuss in this paper. Based on an analysis of 10 use cases, PIDINST developed a metadata schema and prototyped schema implementation with DataCite and ePIC as representative persistent identifier infrastructures and with HZB (Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie) and BODC (British Oceanographic Data Centre) as representative institutional instrument providers. These implementations demonstrate the viability of the proposed solution in practice. Moving forward, PIDINST will further catalyse adoption and consolidate the schema by addressing new stakeholder requirements.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-05-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-018</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-018</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 18</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-018/962</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-018/963</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-018/2337</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-018</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-018</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It is well-known for the Weibull distribution that a joint conjugate prior on the parameters does not exist; we use both the informative and noninformative priors on the model parameters. Bayes estimates under LINEX and general entropy loss functions are obtained using the Gibbs sampling scheme. A simulation study is carried out to observe the behavior of the proposed estimators for different sample sizes and for different censoring parameters. It is observed that the Bayes estimators under LINEX and general entropy loss functions can be used effectively with the appropriate choice of respective loss function parameters. One real data set is analyzed for illustrative purposes.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-04-13</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.012-004</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.012-004</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 11 (2012); 72-88</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.012-004/49</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.012-004</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

DFBS provides images and extracted spectra for all objects present in the FBS plates. Programs were developed to compute astrometric solution, extract spectra, and apply wavelength and photometric calibration for objects. A DFBS database and catalog has been assembled containing data for nearly 20,000,000 objects. A classification scheme for the DFBS spectra is being developed. The Armenian Virtual Observatory is based on the DFBS database and other large-area surveys and catalogue data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-05-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-072</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.007-072</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 152-161</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-072/232</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.007-072</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Medical data mining has been a popular data mining topic of late. Compared with other data mining areas, medical data mining has some unique characteristics. Because medical files are related to human subjects, privacy concerns are taken more seriously than other data mining tasks. This paper applied data separation-based techniques to preserve privacy in classification of medical data. We take two approaches to protect privacy: one approach is to vertically partition the medical data and mine these partitioned data at multiple sites; the other approach is to horizontally split data across multiple sites. In the vertical partition approach, each site uses a portion of the attributes to compute its results, and the distributed results are assembled at a central trusted party using a majority-vote ensemble method. In the horizontal partition approach, data are distributed among several sites. Each site computes its own data, and a central trusted party is responsible to integrate these results. We implement these two approaches using medical datasets from UCI KDD archive and report the experimental results.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-08-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S429</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S429</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S429-S434</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S429/430</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S429</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We have adopted ORACLE as the database and use JSP (Java Server Pages) technology to create dynamic pages. The basic function of the network is to store, check, inquire, and renew the data. Users can query and download the data in txt form and view pictures generated by Matlab. At present the system is running well in both versions: Chinese and English, each having a unified style.

Cloud computing has the advantage of high scalability and reliability, which can provide firm technical support. This paper proposes a highly scalable geospatial cloud platform named the Geospatial Data Cloud, which is constructed based on cloud computing. The architecture of the platform is first introduced, and then two subsystems, the cloud-based data management platform and the cloud-based data processing platform, are described. –––This paper was presented at the First Scientific Data Conference on Scientific Research, Big Data, and Data Science, organized by CODATA-China and held in Beijing on 24-25 February, 2014.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-11-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-042</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-042</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 254-264</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-042/17</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-042</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

During the International Polar Year (IPY 2007–2008), a remarkable number of data/metadata involving multi-disciplinary science activities were compiled. Although the long-term stewardship of the accumulation of metadata falls to the data center of NIPR, the work has been in collaboration with the Global Change Master Directory, the Polar Information Commons, the World Data System and other data science bodies/communities under the International Council for Science. In addition, links with other data centers, such as the Data Integration and Analysis System Program of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems and the Polar Data Catalogue of Canada were initiated in 2014 using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting.

Where OAIS compliant digital preservation has been established in recent years, in almost all cases the services aim at the preservation of file-based objects. In the Digital Humanities, research data is often represented in highly structured aggregations, such as Scholarly Digital Editions. Naturally, scholars would like their editions to remain functionally complete as long as possible. Besides standard components like webservers, the presentation typically relies on project specific code interacting with client software like webbrowsers. Especially the latter being subject to rapid change over time invariably makes such environments awkward to maintain once funding has ended. Pragmatic approaches have to be found in order to balance the curation effort and the maintainability of access to research data over time.A sketch of four potential service levels aiming at the long-term availability of research data in the humanities is outlined: (1) Continuous Maintenance, (2) Application Conservation, (3) Application Data Preservation, and (4) Bitstream Preservation. The first being too costly and the last hardly satisfactory in general, we suggest that the implementation of services by an infrastructure provider should concentrate on service levels 2 and 3.

However, the quality of the data affects the quality of decisions. Data mining as one of the most important sources of knowledge needs high quality data to mine, but there are not enough good quality data in many enterprises. By analyzing the reasons for low data quality systematically, a new method called data mining consulting for improving data quality has been established. It defines data quality in a wider sense from the view of data mining, finds data quality problems, and solves data quality problems by a series of methods. Its application shows that it has good practicality and can increase data quality considerable.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-12</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S658</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S658</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S658-S666</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S658/480</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S658</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

To that end, we developed a method to automatically convert photographic records to one-minute digital data. We applied our method to the observation records of Kakioka Magnetic Observatory and confirmed that the resolution of time and amplitude could be greatly improved by numerical conversion compared with conventional data conversion by hand scaling. Our results suggest that highly precise digitization of analog magnetograms is possible.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-05-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-046</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-046</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS254-WDS257</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-046/167</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-046</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, the risk for low and low dose-rate radiation is obscure because of a lack of evidence. This risk is currently estimated by extrapolating the radiation response at high doses into low dose ranges for practical purposes. Recent challenges to examine directly the biological responses to low dose radiation using newly developed technologies are unveiling interesting alterations at the molecular level. The interpretation of these data, however, needs careful consideration because they may not be related to any change in biological functions.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-06-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.BR-01</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.BR-01</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009): Special Issue; PBR1-BR4</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.BR-01/251</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.BR-01</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

DataSHIELD (Data Aggregation Through Anonymous Summary-statistics from Harmonised Individual-levEL Databases) is a distributed approach that allows the analysis of sensitive individual-level data from one study, and the co-analysis of such data from several studies simultaneously without physically pooling them or disclosing any data. Following initial proof of principle, a stable DataSHIELD platform has now been implemented in a number of epidemiological consortia. This paper reports three new applications of DataSHIELD including application to post-publication sensitive data analysis, text data analysis and privacy protected data visualisation. Expansion of DataSHIELD analytic functionality and application to additional data types demonstrate the broad applications of the software beyond biomedical sciences. </dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-021</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-021</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 21</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-021/667</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-021/668</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/331</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/332</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/333</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/334</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/335</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/336</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/337</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/338</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/339</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-021</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-021</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The CR equals the total number of citations of a publication divided by the median of citations of its references and was tested for the top 5% of the most-cited publications of 13 selected disciplines in sciences, social sciences and humanities. Each publication had a CR = 0 until it was firstly cited. At CR = 1 the number of citations equalled the median of citations of the references. CRs of the most-cited publications mostly ranged between 1 and 10 and were not significantly different across the selected disciplines. In contrast, the total number of citations of the same publications were significantly different across disciplines. One of the advantages of the CR is that it can be calculated for any publication as long as it has references (e.g. books, book chapters, reports, and symposium contributions).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-05-27</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-019</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-019</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 19</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-019/837</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-019/838</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-019/703</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-019/1714</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-019</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-019</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">International</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The data flood has outpaced our capability to process, manage, analyze, and provide intelligent services. Extracting valuable information from the huge data ocean is necessary for improving the quality of domain services. The most acute information management challenges today stem from organizations relying on amounts of diverse, interrelated data sources, but having no way to manage the dataspaces in an integrated, user-demand driven and services convenient way. Thus, we proposed the model of Virtual DataSpace (VDS) in materials science field to organize multi-source and heterogeneous data resources and offer services on the data in place without losing context information. First, the concept and theoretical analysis are described for the model. Then the methods for construction of the model is proposed based on users’ interests. Furthermore, the dynamic evolution algorithm of VDS is analyzed using the user feedback mechanism. Finally, we showed its efficiency for intelligent, real-time, on-demand services in the field of materials engineering.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-07-08</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-007</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2016-007</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 7</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-007/595</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-007/596</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/148</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/149</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/150</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/151</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/152</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/153</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-007</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-007</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, little is known about the total size, characteristics, and sustainability of these data. In the scholarly sphere, it is widely suspected that there is a gap between the amount of valuable digital data that is produced and the amount that is effectively stewarded and made accessible. The Stewardship Gap Project (http://bit.ly/stewardshipgap) investigates characteristics of, and measures, the stewardship gap for sponsored scholarly activity in the United States. This paper presents a preliminary definition of the stewardship gap based on a review of relevant literature and investigates areas of the stewardship gap for which metrics have been developed and measurements made, and where work to measure the stewardship gap is yet to be done. The main findings presented are 1) there is not one stewardship gap but rather multiple “gaps” that contribute to whether data is responsibly stewarded; 2) there are relationships between the gaps that can be used to guide strategies for addressing the various stewardship gaps; and 3) there are imbalances in the types and depths of studies that have been conducted to measure the stewardship gap.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-08-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-019</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-019</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 19</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-019/769</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-019/770</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-019/696</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-019/697</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-019/698</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-019/699</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-019/1078</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-019</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-019</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Primarily North America and Europe</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Most recent fifteen years</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Review of significant literature</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, there is a lack of attention to scientific data even when scientists and researchers are facing an increasing data deluge. In this study, we carried out a two-phase (first exploratory and then empirical) research to explore relevance judgment patterns of scientific data users. In the exploratory study, we interviewed 23 subjects who participated in a national competition related to scientific data. Five relevance criteria (RC) and seven paths of their usage were identified by content analysis of the transcribed records of the interview. Based on the results of the first phase, seven hypotheses were proposed and verified by partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The study identified five RC, i.e. topicality, accessibility, authority, quality and usefulness used by scientific data users. Three patterns were identified including 1) data topicality judgment as the first step or starting point, 2) data reliability judgment as the necessary process and 3) data utility judgment as final purpose. These findings provide new understanding of relevance judgement and behaviours of scientific data users, and could benefit the design for cognitive retrieval systems and algorithms specific to scientific data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-03-09</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-009</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 9</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-009/941</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-009/942</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1878</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1879</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1880</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1881</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1882</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1883</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1884</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-009</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-009</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Although group discussion is known to be effective for analyzing data from various viewpoints, the number of participants is limited by time and space constraints. To solve that problem, this paper proposes to augment a BBS, a popular web based tool. In order for discussion participants to share data online, the system provides them with a visual representation of target data, which elicits comments from participants as well as compares these comments. In order to illustrate the concept's potential, a BBS equipped with KeyGraph is also developed for supporting online chance discovery. It has functions for making visual annotations on the KeyGraph as well as a function for retrieving similar scenarios. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the BBS in terms of the usefulness of scenario generation support functions as well as that of scenario retrieval engines.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S28</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S28</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S28-S38</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S28/381</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S28</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It also reports a small-scale simulation study to indicate factors which can influence the bias correction to be small or large. For the complete data-set, it is observed that the maximum likelihood estimates and Schaefer's bias-corrected estimates are not greatly different. However, when the original sample size is reduced by about 50%, the difference between the estimates is found to be much larger, possibly even large enough to influence the conclusions drawn. The impact of transformation and categorization is visibly present. However, the broad impression gained in categorization is the same though difference in types of categorizations can not be overlooked. A factor which seems to influence the size of the bias correction is identified.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-07-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.100</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.100</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 100-107</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.100/462</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.100</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

To obtain accurate and reliable visualization results, the density of the magnetic flux lines should map the magnetic induction intensity, and seed points should determine the density of the magnetic flux lines. However, the traditional seeding algorithm, which is a statistical algorithm based on data, will produce errors when computing magnetic flux through subdivision of the plane. To achieve higher accuracy, more subdivisions should be made, which will reduce efficiency. This paper analyzes the errors made when the traditional seeding algorithm is used and gives an improved algorithm. It then validates the accuracy and efficiency of the improved algorithm by comparing the results of the two algorithms with results from the equivalent magnetic flux algorithm.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-006</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-006</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 6</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-006/539</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-006/540</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-006</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-006</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Because conventional optimization techniques are unable to tackle large-scale feature selection problems, meta-heuristic algorithms are widely used. In this paper, we propose a particle swarm optimization technique while utilizing regression techniques for feature selection. We then use the selected features to classify the data. Classification accuracy is used as a criterion to evaluate classifier performance, and classification is accomplished through the use of k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and Bayesian techniques. Various high dimensional data sets are used to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed approach. Results show that our approach gives better results when compared with other conventional feature selection algorithms.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-11-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-032</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-032</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 106-118</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-032/8</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-032</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Redundancy in the variables was established, and this led us to derive a generalized (macroscopic state) variable, being a fitness/frailty index that reflects both individual and group health status. Evaluation of the relationship between fitness/frailty and the mortality rate revealed that the latter could be expressed in terms of variables generally available from any cross-sectional database. In practical terms, this means that the risk of mortality might readily be assessed from standard biomedical appraisals collected for other purposes.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2003-01-12</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.25</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.2.25</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 2 (2003); 25-34</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.25/191</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.2.25</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Both the second and third principal components show clear daily variation, being high during work hours and low at night and on weekends. The mean eigenvalue of the third component at night (00:00-04:00 LT) increased about 40 days before the earthquake and returned to normal 10 days before the earthquake.

This method, originally dedicated to scientific fields, measures the association strength between terms in documents to reveal and visualise the evolution of scientific fields through the construction of clusters and strategic diagram. This method has since been successfully applied to investigate the structure of many scientific areas. Nowadays it occurs in many software systems which are used by companies to improve their business, and define their strategy but its relevance to this kind of application has not been proved yet. Using the example of economic and marketing information on DSL technologies from Reuters Business Briefing, this presentation gives an interpretation of co-word analysis for this kind of information. After an overview of the software we used (Sampler) and after an outline of the experimental protocol, we investigate and explain each step of the co-word analysis process: terminological extraction, computation of clusters and the strategic diagram. In particular, we explain the meaning of each parameter of the method: the choice of variables and similarity measures is discussed. Finally we try to give a global interpretation of the method in an economic context. Further studies will be added to this work in order to allow a generalisation of these results.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.80</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.3.80</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 3 (2004); 80-87</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.80/275</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.3.80</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Notably, those within developing countries are sometimes regarded as experiencing hardware infrastructure challenges and data management skill shortages. Proposed remedies often focus on the provision of information and communication technology as well as enhanced data management training. Building on prior empirical social research undertaken in sub-Sahara Africa, this article provides a complementary but alternative proposal; namely, fostering data openness by enabling research. Towards this end, the underlying rationale is outlined for a ‘bottom-up’ system of research support that addresses the day-to-day demands in low-resourced environments. This approach draws on lessons from development financial assistance programs in recent decades. In doing so, this article provides an initial framework for science funding that call for holding together concerns for ensuring research can be undertaken in low-resourced laboratory environments with concerns about the data generated in such settings can be shared.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-09-13</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-044</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-044</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 44</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-044/714</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-044/715</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-044</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-044</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Africa</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The EU-funded SEACRIFOG project is designing an observation network which aims at reducing these uncertainties. In this practice paper, we present the various steps towards the design of this network and discuss the data-related implications. This includes the formulation of appropriate observational requirements for each variable considered essential to quantify Africa-wide climate forcing as well as an assessment of corresponding available observational infrastructures and data in order to determine data gaps, needs and priorities. The results are intended to inform the design of an interoperable African data infrastructure for environmental observations.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\">European Commission, project ID 730995</dc:contributor><dc:date>2019-08-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-042</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-042</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 42</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-042/884</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-042/885</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-042/1618</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-042/1619</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-042/1620</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-042/1806</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-042</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-042</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Africa</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

While there have been many conceptual frameworks developed and case reports of individual archives and digital repositories, there have been few empirical studies of how such archives persist over time. In this paper, we draw upon organizational studies theories to approach the issue of sustainability from an organizational perspective, focusing specifically on the organizational histories of three social science data archives (SSDA): ICPSR, UKDA, and LIS. Using a framework of organizational resilience to understand how archives perceive crisis, respond to it, and learn from experience, this article reports on an empirical study of sustainability in these long-lived SSDAs. The study draws from archival documents and interviews to examine how sustainability can and should be conceptualized as on-going processes over time and not as a quality at a single moment. Implications for research and practice in data archive sustainability are discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-012</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-012</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 12</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-012/648</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-012/649</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-012</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-012</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">1960s-1980s</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The assumption is that reuse or secondary use of research data saves researchers time in not having to produce data for a publication themselves. This can make science more efficient and productive. However, if there is no reuse, time costs in making data available for reuse will have been made with no return on this investment. In this paper a mathematical model is used to calculate the break-even point for time spent sharing in a scientific community, versus time gain by reuse. This is done for several scenarios; from simple to complex datasets to share and reuse, and at different sharing rates. The results indicate that sharing research data can indeed cause an efficiency revenue for the scientific community. However, this is not a given in all modeled scenarios. The scientific community with the lowest reuse needed to reach a break-even point is one that has few sharing researchers and low time investments for sharing and reuse. This suggests it would be beneficial to have a critical selection of datasets that are worth the effort to prepare for reuse in other scientific studies. In addition, stimulating reuse of datasets in itself would be beneficial to increase efficiency in scientific communities.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-03-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-010</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-010</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 10</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-010/819</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-010/820</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-010/1154</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-010/1487</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-010/1488</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-010/1489</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-010/1490</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-010</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-010</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This requires that data are findable and accessible on the Web, and comply with shared standards making them interoperable and reusable in alignment with the FAIR principles. It takes considerable time, energy, expertise and motivation. It is imperative to facilitate the processes to encourage scientists to share their data. To that aim, supporting FAIR principles compliance processes and increasing the human understanding of FAIRness criteria – i.e., promoting FAIRness literacy – and not only the machine-readability of the criteria, are critical steps in the data sharing process. Appropriate human-understandable criteria must be the first identified in the FAIRness assessment processes and roadmap. This paper reports on the lessons learned from the RDA SHARC Interest Group on identifying the processes required to prepare FAIR implementation in various communities not specifically data skilled, and on the procedures and training that must be deployed and adapted to each practice and level of understanding. These are essential milestones in developing adapted support and credit back mechanisms not yet in place.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-08-11</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-032</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-032</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 32</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-032/988</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-032/989</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2271</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2272</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2273</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2274</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2275</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2276</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2534</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2535</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2536</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2537</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2538</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2539</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2540</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2594</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2595</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2596</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2597</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2598</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-032</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-032</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">International</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Work done in RDA SHARC interest group (BoF april 2017)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">NA</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This is the NBS where MET Norway has the technical responsibility in terms of providing the infrastructure and storage capacity for data management. Serving the data through two separate platforms, the end users have access to the data in its original format in addition to Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 products in NetCDF-4/CF. Using the latter format, services like regridding, subsetting, visualization and aggregation are integrated utilizing OPeNDAP in combination with OGC WMS and OGC WPS. In addition, data uploading and retrieving operations are simplified for an end user since streaming of data by means of OPeNDAP is supported in multiple programming languages. Due to the strong coupling between space based earth observations, in-situ observation, model data etc, disseminating data in a generic data management system utilizing NetCDF-4/CF and OPeNDAP is convenient for seamless integration across branches. However, the current CF version is not mature for handling all parts of the Sentinel data but future development looks very promising.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-12-27</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-061</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-061</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 61</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-061/923</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-061/924</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-061/1441</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-061/1442</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-061/1443</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-061/1444</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-061/2078</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-061</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-061</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">POLYGON((-10.56562687447763 58.280616106607425,32.55355307271472 58.280616106607425,32.55355307271472 81.28322827667432,-10.56562687447763 81.28322827667432,-10.56562687447763 58.280616106607425))</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The main objective of this approach in the geoscience domain is the improvement of understanding, integration, and usage of Earth and space science related web content in terms of data, information, and knowledge for machines and people. The modeling and representation of semantic attributes and relations within and among documents can be realized by human readable concept maps and machine readable OWL documents. The objectives for the usage of the Semantic Web approach in the GFZ data center ISDC project are the design of an extended classification of metadata documents for product types related to instruments, platforms, and projects as well as the integration of different types of metadata related to data product providers, users, and data centers. Sources of content and semantics for the description of Earth and space science product types and related classes are standardized metadata documents (e.g., DIF documents), publications, grey literature, and Web pages. Other sources are information provided by users, such as tagging data and social navigation information. The integration of controlled vocabularies as well as folksonomies plays an important role in the design of well formed ontologies.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2012-10-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IGY-014</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IGY-014</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 11 (2012): Special Issue; S140-S153</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper, an ontology structure to formalize this kind of process is discussed using an example of the translation of creep property data into design data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-06-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.52</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.52</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 52-63</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.52/453</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.52</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We have so many different kinds numbers of Chinese speech corpora that it is important to be able to conveniently share these speech corpora to avoid wasting time and money and to make research work more efficient. The primary goal of this research is to find a standard scheme which can make the corpus be established more efficiently and be used or shared more easily.

It is increasingly recognized that to exclude Traditional Knowledge from repositories of polar data would both limit the value of such repositories and perpetuate colonial legacies of exclusion and exploitation. However, the inclusion of Traditional Knowledge within repositories that are conceived and designed for Western scientific knowledge raises its own unique challenges. There is increasing acceptance of the need to make these two knowledge systems interoperable but in addition to the technical challenge there are legal and ethical issues involved. These relate to ‘ownership’ or custodianship of the knowledge; obtaining appropriate consent to gather, use and incorporate this knowledge; being sensitive to potentially different norms regarding access to and sharing of some types of knowledge; and appropriate acknowledgement for data contributors. In some cases, respectful incorporation of Traditional Knowledge may challenge standard conceptions regarding the sharing of data, including through open data licensing. These issues have not been fully addressed in the existing literature on legal interoperability which does not adequately deal with Traditional Knowledge. In this paper we identify legal and ethical norms regarding the use of Traditional Knowledge and explore their application in the particular context of polar data. Drawing upon our earlier work on cybercartography and Traditional Knowledge we identify the elements required in the development of a framework for the inclusion of Traditional Knowledge within data infrastructures.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-02-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-003</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-003</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 3</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/Array</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-003/624</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-003/625</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-003/67</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-003</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-003</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess</dc:rights><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We identified significant locations of users such as home, work, and other based on a combined measure of frequency, duration, time, and day of mobile phone interactions. Consecutive mobile phone records of users are used to identify stay and pass-by locations. A stay location is where users spend a significant amount of their time measured through their mobile phone usage. Trips are constructed for each user between two consecutive stay locations in a day and then categorized by purpose and time of the day. Three measures of entropy are used to further understand the regularity of user’s spatiotemporal mobility patterns. The results show that user’s in a high entropy cluster has high percentage of non-home based trips (77%), and user’s in a low entropy cluster has high percentage of commuting trips (49%), indicating high regularity. A set of doubly constrained trip distribution models is estimated. To measure travel cost, the concept of a centroid point that assumes the origins and destinations of all trips are concentrated at an arbitrary location such as the centroid of a zone is replaced by multiple origins and destinations represented by cell tower locations. Note that a cell tower location can only be used as trips origin/destination location when a stay is detected. The travel cost measured between cell tower locations has resulted in shorter trip distances and the model estimation shows less sensitivity to the distance-decay effect.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-01-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-001</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-001</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 1</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-001/801</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-001/802</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-001/1194</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-001/1195</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-001/1196</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-001/1197</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-001/1198</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-001/1199</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-001/1200</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-001/1201</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-001</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-001</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Focussing on a specific non-designated community, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five artists in relation to five works. Data reuse is a critical component of all these works. The qualitative content analysis brings to light agonistic-antagonistic practices in data reuse and shows multiple deconstructions of the notion of data value as it is portrayed in the data reuse literature.

We examine the techniques needed to produce accurate computations of function data, and through a careful evaluation of several prototypes, we address the advantages and disadvantages of using various technologies, including the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML), interactive embedded graphics, and video capture to render and disseminate the visualizations in an environment accessible to users on various platforms.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S146</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S146</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S146-S154</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S146/395</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S146</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Opportunities emerge to re-visit long-standing approaches to managing data and to critically examine new capabilities. We describe the cognitive importance of metaphor. We describe several metaphors for managing, sharing, and stewarding data and examine their strengths and weaknesses. We particularly question the applicability of a “publication” approach to making data broadly available. Our preliminary conclusions are that no one metaphor satisfies enough key data system attributes and that multiple metaphors need to co-exist in support of a healthy data ecosystem. We close with proposed research questions and a call for continued discussion.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-01-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-042</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-042</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS32-WDS46</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-042/61</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-042</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

On the one hand, it supports a semi-automatic domain ontology acquisition and dynamic maintenance, and on the other hand, it supports an auto-indexing and auto-classification of Chinese scholarly literature.

However, the complete data erasure from recorded media is also important for the security of the data. After erasure of data from optical disks, recycling the material is needed in order to recover the valuable components of the optical disks. Here, data erasure methods for optical disks are discussed in the view of material recycling. The main finding of the study is that the explosion of optical disks in water is a very suitable method for complete erasure of data on the disks as well as recycling of their materials.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S11</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S11</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S11-S17</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S11/379</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S11</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We introduce two results of high temporal resolution visualization: the magnetic flux rope generation process and dayside reconnection using a system of magnetic field line tracing.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-03-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-023</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj.WDS-023</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS134-WDS138</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-023/106</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj.WDS-023</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Taking the original data of satellite cloud images as the source, this paper depicts specifically the technology of 3D satellite cloud imaging through the transforming of coordinates and projection, creating a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) of cloud imaging and 3D simulation. A Mercator projection was introduced to create a cloud image DEM, while solutions for geodetic problems were introduced to calculate distances, and the outer-trajectory science of rockets was introduced to obtain the elevation of clouds. For demonstration, we report on a computer program to simulate the 3D satellite cloud images.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-05-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S270</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S270</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S270-S277</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S270/410</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S270</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Using a mixture of several different data sources may have benefits but may also lead to severe data quality problems, such as inconsistent data and missing values. There have been efforts to produce more consistent data sets from multiple data sources. However, because of the huge gaps in data quality among the different sources, data quality inequality among different regions and time intervals has still occurred in the resultant data sets. As the construction methods of these data sets are quite complicated, it would be difficult for users to know the data quality of a dataset not to mention the data quality for a specified location or a given time interval. In this paper, the authors address the problem by generating a data quality measure for all regions and time intervals of a dataset. The data quality measure is computed by comparing the constructed datasets and their sources or other relevant data, using data mining techniques. This paper also demonstrates how to handle major quality problems, such as outliers and missing values, by using data mining techniques in the geoscience data, especially in global climate data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S738</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S738</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S738-S742</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S738/491</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S738</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The project’s primary data consist of editions of Greek texts; automated and manually created readings analyze the texts across historical and thematic axes. This paper describes an abstract model we follow in documenting an open-ended body of diverse analyses. The analyses apply to passages of texts at different levels of granularity; they may refer to overlapping or mutually exclusive passages of text; and they may apply to non-contiguous passages of text. All are recorded in with explicit, concise, machine-actionable canonical citation of both text passage and analysis in a scheme aligning all analyses to a common notional text. We cite our texts with urns that capture a passage’s position in an Ordered Hierarchy of Citation Objects (ohco2). Analyses are modeled as data-objects with five properties.We create collections of ‘analytical objects’, each uniquely identified by its own urn and each aligned to a particular edition of a text by a urn citation. We can view these analytical objects as an extension of the edition’s citation hierarchy; since they are explicitly ordered by their alignment with the edition they analyze, each collection of analyses meets satisfies the (ohco2) model of a citable text. We call these texts that are derived from and aligned to an edition ‘analytical exemplars’.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-12-16</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-017</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2016-017</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 17</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-017/617</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-017/616</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-017</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-017</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">1300 BCE - 1453 CE</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Texts in ancient Greek</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Deterioration, format obsolescence, and insufficient metadata for discovery are significant problems leading to loss of scientific data. The research presented in this paper considers these potentially lost data. Four one-hour focus groups and a demographic survey were conducted with 14 scientists to learn about their attitudes toward endangered data, data sharing, data reuse, and their opinions of the DARI inventory. The results indicate that unavailability, lack of context, accessibility issues, and potential endangerment are key concerns to scientists.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-01-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12-048</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.12-048</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013); 207-219</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12-048/51</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.12-048</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

As the world engages with open data, big data reuse, and data linkage, what do data-driven futures look like for communities plagued by data inequities? Indigenous data stakeholders and non-Indigenous allies have explored this question over the last three years in a series of meetings through the Research Data Alliance (RDA). Drawing on RDA and other gatherings, and a systematic scan of literature and practice, we consider possible answers to this question in the context of Indigenous peoples vis-á-vis two emerging concepts: Indigenous data sovereignty and Indigenous data governance. Specifically, we focus on the data challenges facing Native nations and the intersection of data, tribal sovereignty, and power. Indigenous data sovereignty is the right of each Native nation to govern the collection, ownership, and application of the tribe’s data. Native nations exercise Indigenous data sovereignty through the interrelated processes of Indigenous data governance and decolonizing data. This paper explores the implications of Indigenous data sovereignty and Indigenous data governance for Native nations and others. We argue for the repositioning of authority over Indigenous data back to Indigenous peoples. At the same time, we recognize that  there are significant obstacles to rebuilding effective Indigenous data systems and the process will require resources, time, and partnerships among Native nations, other governments, and data agents.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-07-08</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-031</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-031</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 31</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-031/859</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-031/860</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-031/1208</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-031/1209</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-031/1556</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-031/1768</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-031/1769</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-031/1770</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-031</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-031</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">United States</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, due to the flood of publications, the literature survey process has become a highly time-consuming and tangled process, especially for novices of the discipline. Therefore, tools supporting the literature-survey process may help the individual scientist to explore new useful domains. Natural language processing (NLP) is expected as one of the promising techniques to retrieve, abstract, and extract knowledge. In this contribution, NLP is firstly applied to the literature of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which is a sub-discipline of materials science and is a complex and interdisciplinary field of research involving chemists, physicists, engineers, and materials scientists. Causal knowledge extraction from the literature is demonstrated using NLP.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-11-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.108</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.108</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 108-118</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.108/465</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.108</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this study, we present a computational method for novel drug use prediction based on the idea that similar drugs are indicated for similar diseases. When computing drug pairwise similarities, we considered both chemical structure and drug target similarities. In validation, our new drug use predictions were found to be significantly enriched in both the biomedical literature and clinical trials.

Collocating freely available Earth observation data on a cloud computing infrastructure may create opportunities unforeseen by the original data provider for innovation and value-added data re-use, but existing systems at data centers are not designed for supporting requests for large data transfers. A lack of common methodology necessitates that each data center handle such requests from different cloud vendors differently. Guidelines are needed to support enabling all cloud vendors to utilize a common methodology for bulk-downloading data from data centers, thus preventing the providers from building custom capabilities to meet the needs of individual vendors.This paper presents recommendations distilled from use cases provided by three cloud vendors (Amazon, Google, and Microsoft) and are based on the vendors’ interactions with data systems at different Federal agencies and organizations. These specific recommendations range from obvious steps for improving data usability (such as ensuring the use of standard data formats and commonly supported projections) to non-obvious undertakings important for enabling bulk data downloads at scale. These recommendations can be used to evaluate and improve existing data systems for high-volume data transfers, and their adoption can lead to cloud vendors utilizing a common methodology.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-01-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-002</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-002</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 2</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-002/735</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-002/736</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-002</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-002</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">N/A</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">N/A</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">N/A</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We first outlined a general framework about usability using conceptual modelling, including Data, Users and Methodologies. We then defined keywords into classes and their relations. A central ternary relation is enhanced to describe usability. In the second section, we present ESDA with its fundamental basics: i.e. robustness and way(s) to handle data and related graphic tools. We also described the software package ARPEGE'.

Modern data archive systems require higher adaptivity, reliability, and performance than traditional data archive systems can provide. Recently Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) has been applied to a data archive that stores data in a multi-level storage system according to access frequency. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a novel HSM-based data archive system called T-Archive, which can meet the above requirements for order-of-magnitude scaling of storage.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-08-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S441</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S441</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S441-S444</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S441/433</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S441</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Drivers included recent U.S. legislation focused on data and asset management conducted by federal agencies spending $100M USD or more annually on research activities. The methods entailed seeking existing evaluation criteria from national and international organizations such as International Standards Organization (ISO), U.S. Library of Congress, and Data Seal of Approval upon which to model USGS repository evaluations. Certification, complexity, cost, and usability of existing evaluation models were key considerations. The selected evaluation method was derived to allow the repository evaluation process to be transparent, understandable, and defensible; factors that are critical for judging competing, internal units. Implementing the chosen evaluation criteria involved establishing a cross-agency, multi-disciplinary team that interfaced across the organization. </dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-022</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-022</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 22</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-022/669</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-022/670</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-022</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-022</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Taiwan, hence, embarked on a decade of integrating biodiversity data. Under the support of NSC and COA, the database and websites of TaiBIF, TaiBNET (TaiCOL), TaiBOL, and TaiEOL have been established separately and collaborate with the GBIF, COL, BOL, and EOL respectively. A cross-agency committee was thus established in Academia Sinica in 2008 to formulate policies on data collection and integration as well as the mechanism to make data available to the public. Any commissioned project will hereafter be asked to include these policy requirements in its contract. So far, TaiBIF has gained recognition in Taiwan and abroad for its efforts over the past several years. It can provide its experience and insights for others to reference or replicate.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-02-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-008</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-008</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS61-WDS69</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-008/69</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-008</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Optical character recognition (OCR) was used to recover tables from 740 papers. Tables from only 41 percent of the 2600 articles are available in the CDS or CATS catalog collections, and only slightly better coverage is estimated for the NED database. This fraction is not better for articles published electronically since 2001. Both object databases (NED, SIMBAD, LEDA) as well as catalog browsers (VizieR, CATS) need to be consulted to obtain the most complete information on astronomical objects. More human resources at the data centers and better collaboration between authors, referees, editors, publishers, and data centers are required to improve data coverage and accessibility. The current efforts within the Virtual Observatory (VO) project, to provide retrieval and analysis tools for different types of published and archival data stored at various sites, should be balanced by an equal effort to recover and include large amounts of published data not currently available in this way.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-03-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.41</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.8.41</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 41-51</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.41/203</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.8.41</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This system also has some teaching functions, improves the analysis of datasets based on calculating the values of the TDS (Total Dermatoscopy Score) (Braun-Falco, Stolz, Bilek, Merkle, &amp;amp; Landthaler, 1990; Hippe, Bajcar, Blajdo, Grzymala-Busse, Grzymala-Busse, &amp;amp; Knap, et al., 2003) parameter. Calculations are based on two methods: the classical ABCD formula (Braun-Falco et al., 1990) and the optimized ABCD formula (Alvarez, Bajcar, Brown, Grzymala-Busse, &amp;amp; Hippe, 2003). A third method of classification is devoted to quasi-optimal decision trees (Quinlan, 1993). The developed internet-based tool enables users to make an early, non-invasive diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. This is possible using a built-in set of instructions that animates the diagnosis of the four basic lesions types: benign nevus, blue nevus, suspicious nevus and melanoma malignant. This system is available on the Internet website: http://www.wsiz.rzeszow.pl/ksesi.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.77</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.4.77</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 4 (2005); 77-81</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.77/371</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.4.77</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Despite the importance of collections, many are not maintained or curated as thoroughly as we would like. Part of the reason for this is the lack of professional reward for collection, curation, or maintenance. To address this gap in attribution metadata, the Research Data Alliance (RDA) and the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) organization co-endorsed a Working Group to create recommendations for the representation of attribution metadata. After 18 months, this Working Group recommended the use of PROV entities and properties to link people (Agent), the curatorial actions they perform (Activity), and the digital or physical objects they are curating (Entity). Assigning a Role to an Agent is optional. These recommendations are discussed in the context of the RDA, TDWG, and existing standards. Future work includes adapting these recommendations to the specific needs of TDWG and developing a pilot application in collaboration with ORCID and the Data Futures project.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\">TDWG, Community Support Fund 2017</dc:contributor><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\">US National Science Foundation, Awards 1349002, EF-1115210, DBI-1547229</dc:contributor><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\">RDA Europe 4.0 project that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme No 777388</dc:contributor><dc:date>2019-11-08</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-054</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-054</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 54</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-054/908</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-054/909</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-054/1189</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-054/1190</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-054/1191</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-054</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-054</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Ground data has many limitations including limited data points and lack of data over ocean areas that are not easily accessible. Two regional geomagnetic field modelling techniques, namely polynomial surface modelling (PolyM) and Spherical Cap Harmonic Analysis (SCHA), were applied to CHAMP satellite data recorded between 2001 and 2005 to investigate the use of satellite data to develop a geomagnetic SV model over southern Africa. The resulting regional models of this investigation were validated against the two widely used global field models IGRF 10 and CHAOS-2 using the available ground survey data obtained during the same period over southern Africa. The results suggest that the regional field models can be derived based entirely on satellite data. However, the regional SV models can be improved using both high quality satellite and ground survey data, since they lack the high quality of a global field model like CHAOS-2.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-07-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-11</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-11</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); IAGA64-IAGA68</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-11/97</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-11</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, the colloid deposition structure on rock surfaces has scarcely been studied. In this paper, preliminary results for a fractal characterization for colloid deposition in saturated fractures are presented, which consider the pH value, ionic strength, and flow rate of the solution. Under different chemical conditions, deposition behavior obviously changed, and fractal analysis appears to be an effective tool to capture the evolution and general behavior of depositions. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is used to observe the colloidal growth on granite surfaces and to acquire the visual image on a detailed level. The images are analyzed for their mass fractal dimensions. The influence on colloid fractal deposition is discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-04-26</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S206</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S206</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S206-S219</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S206/402</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S206</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Builders and funders of the cyberinfrastructure designed to enable open data sharing in the geosciences risk a key failure mode: What if geoscientists do not use the cyberinfrastructure to share, discover and reuse data? In this study, we report a baseline assessment of engagement with the NSF EarthCube initiative, an open cyberinfrastructure effort for the geosciences. We find scientists perceive the need for cross-disciplinary engagement and engage where there is organizational or institutional support. However, we also find a possibly imbalanced involvement between cyber and geoscience communities at the outset, with the former showing more interest than the latter. This analysis highlights the importance of examining fields and disciplines as stakeholders to investments in the cyberinfrastructure supporting science.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\">National Science Foundation, NSF OCI RAPID 1229928, NSF GEO-SciSIP-STS-OCI-INSPIRE 1249607</dc:contributor><dc:date>2016-07-11</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-008</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2016-008</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 8</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/Array</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-008/597</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-008/598</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-008</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-008</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">The full planet</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Anthropocene</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Survey of 798 invitees to NSF EarthCube domain scientists workshops</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess</dc:rights><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Recently, we have carried out continuous observations at geodetic observatories and continuous geomagnetic stations and repetitive observations at several first-order geomagnetic stations. The results of the surveys, “geomagnetic charts”, have been published every 10 years. In 2011, GSI released the newest geomagnetic charts for the epoch 2010.0 created by adopting a new spatial-temporal model. This model needs continuous data of good quality. In addition to the GSI geodetic observatories, the Kakioka Magnetic Observatory, which has been conducting high-quality and stable observations for 100 years, makes a large contribution.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-06-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.G-033</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.G-033</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; G1-G8</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.G-033/170</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.G-033</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Researchers of all disciplines are confronted with the pressure to share their research data so that it can be reused. The demand for data use and reuse has implications on how we document, publish and share research in the first place, and, perhaps most importantly, it affects how we measure the impact of research, which is commonly a measurement of its use and reuse. It is surprising that research communities, policy makers, etc. have not clearly defined what use and reuse is yet.We postulate that a clear definition of use and reuse is needed to establish better metrics for a comprehensive scholarly record of individuals, institutions, organizations, etc. Hence, this article presents a first definition of reuse of research data. Characteristics of reuse are identified by examining the etymology of the term and the analysis of the current discourse, leading to a range of reuse scenarios that show the complexity of today’s research landscape, which has been moving towards a data-driven approach. The analysis underlines that there is no reason to distinguish use and reuse. We discuss what that means for possible new metrics that attempt to cover Open Science practices more comprehensively. We hope that the resulting definition will enable a better and more refined strategy for Open Science.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-06-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-022</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-022</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 22</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-022/843</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-022/844</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1278</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1279</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1280</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1281</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1282</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1283</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1284</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1285</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1286</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1287</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1288</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1289</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-022/1717</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-022</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-022</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Constructing an efficient classifier with a small set of high quality rules is a highly important but indeed a challenging task. The lazy learning associative classification method successfully removes the need for a classifier but suffers from high computation costs. This paper proposes a Compact Highest Subset Confidence-Based Associative Classification scheme that generates compact subsets based on information gain and classifies the new samples without constructing classifiers. Experimental results show that the proposed system out performs both the traditional and the existing lazy learning associative classification methods.−−−−−Paper presented at 1st International Symposium on Big Data and Cloud Computing Challenges (ISBCC-2014) March 27-28, 2014.

Due to independent development these repositories serve their communities well, but were developed with different technologies, data models and using different ontologies. Hence, the effectiveness and efficiency of these services can be vastly improved if repositories work together adhering to a shared community platform that focuses on the implementation of agreed upon standards and best practices for curation and dissemination of data. Such a community platform drives forward the convergence of technologies and practices that will advance cross-domain interoperability. It will also facilitate contributions from investigators through standardized and streamlined workflows and provide increased visibility for the role of data managers and the curation services provided by data repositories, beyond preservation infrastructure. Ten specific suggestions for such standardizations are outlined without any suggestions for priority or technical implementation. Although the recommendations are for repositories to implement, they have been chosen specifically with the data provider/data curator and synthesis scientist in mind.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-09-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-022</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-022</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 22</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-022/775</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-022/776</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-022</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-022</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">United States</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The main radio sources observed in this spectral range are the Sun, the magnetized planets (Earth, Jupiter, Saturn), and our Galaxy, which are observed either from ground or space. Ground observatories can capture high resolution data streams with a high sensitivity. Conversely, space-borne instruments can observe below the ionospheric cut-off (at about 10 MHz) and can be placed closer to the studied object. Several tools have been developed in the last decade for sharing space physics data. Data visualization tools developed by various institutes are available to share, display and analyse space physics time series and spectrograms. The MASER team has selected a sub-set of those tools and applied them to low frequency radio astronomy. MASER also includes a Python software library for reading raw data from agency archives.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-03-18</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-012</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-012</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 12</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-012/950</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-012/951</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-012/2110</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-012/2111</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-012/2112</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-012/2113</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-012</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-012</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This handwritten work contains rather rich text information, which should be the contents of forming an electronic database. There are in the original book multi-types of information, including layouts, volumes, chapters, characters, interlinear translation, segments, and Chinese translation, each format of which has been approached in detail and divided separately with markers. On the basis of analysis, our project builds up a complete electronic retrieval system for this great book, which resolves the return to the original shape of the archaic handwriting form with three lines representing one content. The sorting methods of the system are also designed according to the original text formats, namely concordance technology, which can print out retrieved objects with their contexts, retrieve with statistical data, and freely browse search.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-07-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S393</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S393</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S393-S399</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S393/424</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S393</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Since the digital age, many specialised and generic persistent identifier (PID) systems have been used to identify digital objects. Just as many ancient indexes have died over time, so too PID systems have had a lifecycle from inception to active phase to paralysis, and eventually a fall into oblivion. Where the indexes within the Great Library at Alexandria finally succumbed to fire, technology change has been the destroyer of more recent digital indexes.We distil four PID system design principles from observations over the years that we think should be implemented by PID system architects to ensure that their systems survive change. The principles: describe how to ensure identifiers’ system and organisation independence; codify the delivery of essential PID system functions; mandate a separation of PID functions from data delivery mechanisms; and require generation of policies detailing how change is handled.In addition to suggesting specific items for each principle, we propose that a platform-independent model (PIM) be established for persistent identifiers – of any sort and with any resolver technology – in order to enable transition between present and future systems and the preservation of the identifiers’ functioning. We detail our PID system—the PID Service—that implements the proposed principles and a data model to some extent and we describe an implementation case study of an organisation’s implementation of PID systems that implement the Pillars further but still not completely.Penultimately, we describe in a Future Work section, an opportunity for the use of both the Pillars and the PIM; that of the World Wide Web Consortium’s Permanent Identifier Community Group who is seeking to “set up and maintain a secure permanent, URL re-direction service for the web”.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-013</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-013</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 13</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-013/650</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-013/651</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-013</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-013</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">630BC - present</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Although there are clear benefits to data sharing, there is at least one field where this norm has yet to be developed: the behavioural sciences. In this paper, we propose an innovative methodology as a means to change existing norms within the behavioural sciences and move towards increased data sharing. Based on recent advances in social psychology, we theorize that a Survey Research Instrument that takes into account basic psychological processes can be effective in promoting data sharing norms.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2012-03-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.11-DS4</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.11-DS4</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 11 (2012): Special Issue; DS29-DS43</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Data and data systems are central to these new developments in various forms of eScience or grid systems. Space science missions are developing multi-spacecraft, distributed, communications- and computation-intensive, adaptive mission architectures that will further add to the data avalanche. Fortunately, Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) tools are rapidly expanding to meet the need for more efficient information extraction and knowledge generation in this data-intensive environment. Concurrently, scientific data management is being augmented by content-based metadata and semantic services. Archiving, eScience and KDD all require a solid foundation in interoperability and systems architecture. These concepts are illustrated through examples of space science data preservation, archiving, and access, including application of the ISO-standard Open Archive Information System (OAIS) architecture.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.67</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.4.67</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 4 (2005); 67-76</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.67/361</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.4.67</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Policies can be important drivers for research institutions in the implementation of good data management practices. As Rans and Jones note (Rans and Jones 2013), “Policies provide clarity of purpose and may help in the framing of roles, responsibilities and requisite actions. They also legitimise making the case for investment”. However, policy development often tends to place the researchers in a passive position, while they are the ones managing research data on a daily basis. Therefore, at TU Delft, we have taken an alternative approach: a policy needs to go hand in hand with practice. The policy development was initiated by the Research Data Services at TU Delft Library, but as the process continued, other stakeholders, such as legal and IT departments, got involved. Finally, the faculty-based Data Stewards have played a key role in leading the consultations with the research community that led to the development of the faculty-specific policies. This allows for disciplinary differences to be reflected in the policies and to create a closer connection between policies and day-to-day research practice. Our primary intention was to keep researchers and research practices at the centre of our strategy for data management. We did not want to introduce and mandate requirements before adequate infrastructure and professional support were available to our research community and before our researchers were themselves willing to discuss formalisation of data management practices.This paper describes the key steps taken and the most important decisions made during the development of RDM policies at TU Delft.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-09-12</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-045</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-045</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 45</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-045/890</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-045/891</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-045/1834</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-045</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-045</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Netherlands</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Vr index showed 27-day solar-cycle recurrences and significant seasonal variation. It also increased with latitude. Meanwhile, both local-time dependence and an obvious dusk-dawn asymmetry existed, which might be related to the asymmetric ring current, the partial ring current, and the field-aligned current.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-06-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-06</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-06</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); IAGA34-IAGA40</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-06/88</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-06</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Through analysis of documents reporting on meetings of the Arctic data management community, a set of priorities and strategies are identified. These include the need to improve data sharing, make use of existing resources, and better engage stakeholders. Network theory is applied to a preliminary inventory of polar and global data management actors to improve understanding of the emerging community of practice. Under the name the Arctic Data Coordination Network, we propose a model network that can support the community in achieving their goals through improving connectivity between existing actors.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-10-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-16</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-16</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014): Special Issue; PDA94-PDA102</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-16/33</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-16</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The 4th Extremely Large Databases workshop was organized to examine the needs of communities under-represented at the past workshops facing these issues. Approaches to big data statistical analytics as well as emerging opportunities related to emerging hardware technologies were also debated. Writable extreme scale databases and the science benchmark were discussed. This paper is the final report of the discussions and activities at this workshop.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-02-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.xldb10</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.xldb10</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010): Special Issue; MR1-MR8</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.xldb10/161</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.xldb10</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Many papers have been proposed to provide new techniques for mining social networks to help further study this huge amount of data. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them considered the semantic meaning of the nodes interests while clustering the network. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, namely GeoSim, for clustering users in any social network site into communities based on the semantic meaning of the nodes interests as well as their relationships with each other. Moreover, this paper proposes a parallel version of the GeoSim algorithm that utilizes the MapReduce model to run on multiple machines simultaneously and get faster results. The two versions of the algorithm (centralized and parallel) are examined thoroughly to test their performance. The experiments show that both versions of the GeoSim algorithm achieve high community detection accuracy and scale linearly with the size of the cluster.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-04-11</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-013</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-013</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 13</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-013/825</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-013/826</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-013/1537</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-013</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-013</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

As a consequence, numerous applications have emerged that utilize the spatial data to provide different types of location-based services. However, the huge amount of available spatial data presents a challenge to the efficiency of these location-based services. Although the advent of big data frameworks like Apache Spark has enabled the processing of large amounts of data efficiently, they are designed for general (non-spatial) data. That is due to the build-in data partitioning mechanism that does not take into account the spatial proximity of the data. Therefore, these big data frameworks cannot be readily used for spatial analytics such as efficiently answering spatial queries. To fill this gap, this paper proposes SparkNN, an in-memory partitioning and indexing system for answering spatial queries, such as K-nearest neighbor, on big spatial data. SparkNN is implemented on top of Apache Spark and consists of three layers to facilitate efficient spatial queries. The first layer is a spatial-aware partitioning layer, which partitions the spatial data into several partitions ensuring that the load of the partitions is balanced and data objects with close proximity are placed in the same, or neighboring, partitions. The second layer is a local indexing layer, which provides a spatial index inside each partition to speed up the data search within the partition. The third layer is a global index, which is placed in the master node of Spark to route spatial queries to the relevant partitions. The efficiency of SparkNN was evaluated by extensive experiments with big spatial datasets. The results show SparkNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art Spark system when evaluated on the same set of queries.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-08-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-035</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-035</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 35</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-035/994</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-035/995</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-035</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-035</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The data mining clustering technique can be used to accomplish this customer segmentation. This technique clusters the customers in such a way that the customers in one group behave similarly when compared to the customers in other groups. The customer related data are categorical in nature. However, the clustering algorithms for categorical data are few and are unable to handle uncertainty. Rough set theory (RST) is a mathematical approach that handles uncertainty and is capable of discovering knowledge from a database. This paper proposes a new clustering technique called MADO (Minimum Average Dissimilarity between Objects) for categorical data based on elements of RST. The proposed algorithm is compared with other RST based clustering algorithms, such as MMR (Min-Min Roughness), MMeR (Min Mean Roughness), SDR (Standard Deviation Roughness), SSDR (Standard deviation of Standard Deviation Roughness), and MADE (Maximal Attributes DEpendency). The results show that for the real customer data considered, the MADO algorithm achieves clusters with higher cohesion, lower coupling, and less computational complexity when compared to the above mentioned algorithms. The proposed algorithm has also been tested on a synthetic data set to prove that it is also suitable for high dimensional data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-04-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-019</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.13-019</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 1-11</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-019/1</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.13-019</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Additionally it is recognised that data are meaningless unless their provenance is preserved, through appropriate meta-data. Alongside this is a pressing need to ensure the quality and archiving of the software that generates data, through simulation, control of experiment or data-collection and that which analyses, modifies and draws value from raw data. In order to meet the aims of reproducibility we argue that data management alone is insufficient: it must be accompanied by good software practices, the training to facilitate it and the support of stakeholders, including appropriate recognition for software as a research output.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-01-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-003</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-003</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 3</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-003/929</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-003/930</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-003/1827</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-003/2096</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-003</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-003</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Data publication also requires an adequate licence model that protects the intellectual property rights of the author while allowing further use of the data by the scientific community.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-06-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.79</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.79</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 79-83</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.79/456</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.79</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The increasing use of geospatial data and related electronic records presents new challenges for these organizations, which have relied on traditional practices for managing and preserving records in printed form. This article reports on an investigation of current and future needs for managing and preserving geospatial electronic records on the part of localand state-level organizations in the New York City metropolitan region. It introduces the study and describes organizational needs observed, including needs for organizational coordination and interorganizational cooperation throughout the entire data lifecycle.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-25</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.255</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.4.255</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 4 (2005); 255-271</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.255/537</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.4.255</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Often in academic research studies the goals for informatics teams are to build applications that provide extract-transform-load (ETL) functionality to archive and catalog source data that has been collected by the research teams. In consortia that cross species and methodological or scientific domains, building interfaces which supply data in a usable fashion and make intuitive sense to scientists from dramatically different backgrounds increases the complexity for developers. Further, reusing source data from outside one’s scientific domain is fraught with ambiguities in understanding the data types, analysis methodologies, and how to combine the data with those from other research teams. We report on the design, implementation, and performance of a semantic data management application to support the NIMH funded Conte Center at the University of California, Irvine. The Center is testing a theory of the consequences of “fragmented” (unpredictable, high entropy) early-life experiences on adolescent cognitive and emotional outcomes in both humans and rodents. It employs cross-species neuroimaging, epigenomic, molecular, and neuroanatomical approaches in humans and rodents to assess the potential consequences of fragmented unpredictable experience on brain structure and circuitry. To address this multi-technology, multi-species approach, the system uses semantic web techniques based on the Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) to facilitate data ETL functionality. We find this approach enables a low-cost, easy to maintain, and semantically meaningful information management system, enabling the diverse research teams to access and use the data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-09-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-045</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-045</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 45</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-045/717</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-045/718</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-045/693</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-045/694</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-045/695</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-045</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-045</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

These data are used by decision makers for improving the quality of life of citizens. Moreover, researchers are employing sophisticated technologies to analyse these data to address questions that were unapproachable just a few years ago (Helbing &amp;amp; Balietti, 2011).

This Japanese program is building a meta-database for ground-based observations of the Earth’s upper atmosphere, in which metadata connected with various atmospheric radars and photometers, including those located in both polar regions, are archived. By querying the metadata database, researchers are able to access data file/information held by data facilities. Moreover, by utilizing our analysis software, users can download, visualize, and analyze upper-atmospheric data archived in or linked with the system. As a future development, we are looking to make our database interoperable with others.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-09-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-07</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-07</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014): Special Issue; PDA37-PDA43</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-07/24</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-07</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Taking Landscape Ecology in Germany as an example the article demonstrates how to integrate RDM into the research design as a complement of the classic quality control and assurance in empirical research that has, so far, generally been limited to data production. Sharing and reuse of empirical data by scientists as well as thorough peer reviews of knowledge produced by empirical research requires that the problem of the research in question, the operationalized definitions of the objects of investigation and their representative selection are documented and archived as well as the methods of data production including indicators for data quality and all data collected and produced. On this basis, the extent to which this complemented design of research processes has already been realized is demonstrated by research projects of the Chair of Landscape Ecology at the University of Vechta, Germany. This study is part of a joined research project on Research Data Management funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-06-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-026</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-026</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 26</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-026/976</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-026/977</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-026/1736</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-026/1737</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-026</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-026</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Ideally, consistent resource descriptions are easily extracted from each repository, expressed using standard syntactic and semantic structures, and managed and accessed within a distributed, flexible, and scalable software framework. In practice however, seldom do all three of these elements exist. To help address this situation, the Object Oriented Data Technology (OODT) project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has developed an extensible, standards-based resource description scheme that provides the necessary description and management facilities for the discovery of resources across heterogeneous repositories. The OODT resource description scheme can be used across scientific domains to describe any resource. It uses a small set of generally accepted, broadly-scoped descriptors while also providing a mechanism for the inclusion of domain-specific descriptors. In addition, the OODT scheme can be used to capture hierarchical, relational and recursive relationships between resources. In this paper we expand on prior work and describe an intelligent resource discovery framework that consists of separate software and data architectures focusing on the standard resource description scheme. We illustrate intelligent resource discovery using a case study that provides efficient search across distributed repositories using common interfaces and a hierarchy of resource descriptions derived from a complex, domain-specific ontology.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-25</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.171</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.4.171</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 4 (2005); 171-188</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.171/447</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.4.171</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

After two centuries of hydrate research, a great amount of scientific data on gas hydrates has been accumulated. Therefore the means to manage, share, and exchange these data have become an urgent task. At present, metadata (Markup Language) is recognized as one of the most efficient ways to facilitate data management, storage, integration, exchange, discovery and retrieval. Therefore the CODATA Gas Hydrate Data Task Group proposed and specified Gas Hydrate Markup Language (GHML) as an extensible conceptual metadata model to characterize the features of data on gas hydrate. This article introduces the details of modeling portion of GHML.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-06-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.GH25</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.GH25</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007): Special Issue; GH25-GH36</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.GH25/528</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.GH25</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, today’s scientists do not only produce traditional research papers – they produce comprehensive digital resources and collections. TIB’s mission is to develop a supportive framework for a sustainable access to such digital content – focusing on areas of engineering as well as architecture, chemistry, information technology, mathematics and physics. The term digital content comprises all digitally available resources such as audiovisual media, databases, texts, images, spreadsheets, digital lab journals, multimedia, 3D objects, statistics and software code.In executing this mission, TIB provides services for the management of digital content during ongoing and for finished research. This includes: - a technical and administrative infrastructure for indexing, cataloguing, DOI registration and licensing for text and digital objects, namely the TIB DOI registration which is active since 2005, - the administration of the ORCID DE consortium, an institutional network fostering the adoption of ORCID across academic institutions in Germany, - training and consultancy for data management, complemented with a digital repository for the deposition and provision of accessible, traceable and citable research data (RADAR), - a Research and Development Department where innovative projects focus on the visualization and the sustainable access to digital information, and - the development of a supportive framework within the German research data community which accompanies the life cycle of scientific knowledge generation and transfer. Its goal is to harmonize (meta)data display and exchange primarily on a national level (LEIBNIZ DATA project).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-07-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-036</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-036</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 36</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-036/699</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-036/700</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-036/265</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-036</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-036</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In recent years, intellectual property has played a greater role in scientific work. While intellectual property rights may have a positive role to play in some fields of science, so does the public domain. This paper will discuss some of the positive functions of the public domain and ways in which certain legal developments may negatively impact the public domain. It suggests some steps that scientists can take to preserve the positive functions of the public domain for science.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2003-11-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.192</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.2.192</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 2 (2003); 192-197</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.192/217</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.2.192</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This discovery has transformed traditional statistical modeling methods as well as improved consistency for model applicability. The individuals' different characteristics during the evolution of generations, which are randomly changeable, are treated as Markov random processes. This paper also proposes that a GP algorithm with \"optimal individuals reserved strategy\" is the best solution to this problem, and therefore the adaptive individuals finally will be evolved. This will allow practical applications in software reliability modeling analysis and forecasting for failure behaviors. Moreover it can verify the feasibility and availability of the GP algorithm, which is applied to software failure data series forecasting on a theoretical basis. The results show that the GP algorithm is the best solution for software failure behaviors in a variety of disciplines.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-05-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S310</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S310</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S310-S316</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S310/415</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S310</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The data tiers consist of several distributive data servers that are located in each CAS institute and support such unstructured data formats as vector files, remote sensing images or other raster files, documents, multi-media files, tables, and other format files. For the spatial data files, format transformation service is provided. The middle tier involves a centralized metadata server, which stores metadata records of data on all data servers. The primary function of this tier is catalog service, supporting the creation, search, browsing, updating, and deletion of catalogs. The client tier involves an integrated client that provides the end-users interfaces to search, browse, and download data or create a catalog and upload data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-26</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S770</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S770</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S770-S778</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S770/496</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S770</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Partially due to these science drivers, it is common for disciplinary data systems to expand from their original scope in order to accommodate collaborative research. The result is multiple disparate databases with overlapping but incompatible data. In order to enable more complete data integration and analysis, the Observations Data Model Version 2 (ODM2) was developed to be a general information model, with one of its major goals to integrate data collected by in situ sensors with those by ex-situ analyses of field specimens. Four use cases with different science drivers and disciplines have adopted ODM2 because of benefits to their users. The disciplines behind the four cases are diverse – hydrology, rock geochemistry, soil geochemistry, and biogeochemistry. For each case, we outline the benefits, challenges, and rationale for adopting ODM2. In each case, the decision to implement ODM2 was made to increase interoperability and expand data and metadata capabilities. One of the common benefits was the ability to use the flexible handling and comprehensive description of specimens and data collection sites in ODM2’s sampling feature concept. We also summarize best practices for implementing ODM2 based on the experience of these initial adopters. The descriptions here should help other potential adopters of ODM2 implement their own instances or to modify ODM2 to suit their needs.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-02-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-004</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-004</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 4</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-004/626</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-004/629</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-004/154</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-004/155</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-004/443</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-004/444</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-004/445</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-004</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-004</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

GOSIC manages an online portal providing an entry point for users of climate-related global observing systems data and information systems and also helps serve the needs of the World Data Center for Meteorology, Asheville. The GOSIC continues to evolve and expand its responsibilities, and this paper is an update to a similar paper (Diamond &amp;amp; Lief, 2009) that was presented at the 1st ICSU World Data System Conference in Kyoto, Japan in September 2011. Since 2009, there have been considerable updates made to the GOSIC portal that will be discussed in the paper.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-01-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-002</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-002</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS13-WDS16</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-002/55</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-002</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Radionuclide contamination and heavy metals lead to wider virus spread and a higher diversity of virus species. The Chernobyl zone is a territory of enhanced risk and potential threats for the environment.

But it is also the most likely to generate bubble economy, causing financial risks; it will trigger a series of social contradictions and cause social unrest in severe cases. Therefore, it is urgent to improve and optimize the real estate evaluation model. In this study, the real estate was evaluated based on the neural network model optimized by genetic algorithm. Through sorting out and summarizing the real estate data in a period of time, the corresponding model was established and the test data were obtained. The average relative error value of the genetic algorithm optimized neural network model was 3.552, which was smaller than that of the Back-Propagation (BP) neural network prediction model. The experimental conclusion that the new network model was better than the traditional model was obtained. This work opens up a new route of real estate evaluation.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-07-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-036</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-036</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 36</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-036/872</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-036/873</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-036/1586</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-036/1587</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-036/1588</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-036/1589</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-036/1590</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-036</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-036</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

For this purpose, many file organization techniques have already been developed, and much additional research is still going on. Hashing is one developed technique. In this paper we propose an enhanced hashing technique that uses a hash table combined with a binary tree, searching on the binary representation of a portion the primary key of records that is associated with each index of the hash table. The paper contains numerous examples to describe the technique. The technique shows significant improvements in searching, insertion, and deletion for systems with huge amounts of data. The paper also presents the mathematical analysis of the proposed technique and comparative results.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-11-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.143</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.143</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 143-161</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.143/470</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.143</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper, waiting time, crowded time, and driving time between different bus stations on different bus routes at different times of the day are calculated from bus IC cards data history. Then, a multi-objective program with various constraints is suggested to recommend comfortable bus routes for bus passengers, and a genetic algorithm is developed to search for expected solutions. The proposed method is implemented using bus IC cards data from Chongqing, China and will be a promising tool for bus passengers when choosing comfortable bus routes.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-014</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-014</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 14</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-014/557</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-014/558</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-014</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-014</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Recent regulations, mandates, policies, and guidelines set forth by the U.S. government, federal other, and funding agencies, scientific societies and scholarly publishers, have levied stewardship requirements on digital scientific data. This elevated level of requirements has increased the need for a formal approach to stewardship activities that supports compliance verification and reporting. Meeting or verifying compliance with stewardship requirements requires assessing the current state, identifying gaps, and, if necessary, defining a roadmap for improvement. This, however, touches on standards and best practices in multiple knowledge domains. Therefore, data stewardship practitioners, especially these at data repositories or data service centers or associated with data stewardship programs, can benefit from knowledge of existing maturity assessment models. This article provides an overview of the current state of assessing stewardship maturity for federally funded digital scientific data.

This adds significant value not only in respect to objective assessment but also in assisting with evaluation of overlapping and competing criteria, planning of continuous improvement, and progress towards formal evaluation by accreditation authorities.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-04-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-032</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-032</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS189-WDS192</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-032/133</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-032</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Manifold conflicting and shifting values need to be reconciled in pursuing viable data-management policies. For example, how does one make data available in useable form to stakeholders including scientists, governments and businesses worldwide, while assuring confidentiality, satisfying one's research ethics committee, protecting intellectual property and national security, and containing costs? Increasingly, ethical problem solving requires integration of ethics with technological \"know how\" and empirical research on the presenting problem. Each problem is highly contextual; broad application of general ethical principles such as always practice openness, or prepare all data for sharing, may have harmful unintended consequences. Chaos theory provides a heuristic or vision for understanding and coping with complexity and uncertainty. It does not provide answers to problems of data management, but frames the issues, and provides appropriate expectations and heuristics for considering data management problems.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.165</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.4.165</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 4 (2005); 165-170</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.165/438</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.4.165</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The database information comes from major areas of the world, especially the countries adjacent to China, and updates are done continuously. The Sinology Database is in several different languages and should satisfy the differing needs of data collection and database application. The data quality is strictly controlled during the whole data life cycle, which includes data collection, processing, storage, and accessing. In addition, according to the standards and specifications of the metadata, metadata are created to accompany the data, which satisfies the cooperation among different databases. Finally, besides the function of searching, statistical calculation, and sorting, the database is also used for data mining and knowledge discovery. Through these methods, conclusions about changes in Sinology can be drawn, which will aid us in understanding the world and China in particular.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S930</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S930</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S930-S940</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S930/519</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S930</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The agency responses have generated discussion and interest but are yet to be analyzed and compared. In this paper, we examine how 19 federal agencies responded to the memo, written by John Holdren, on issues of scientific data and the extent of their compliance to the directives outlined in the memo. We present a varied picture of the readiness of federal science agencies to comply with the memo through a comparative analysis and close reading of the contents of these responses. While some agencies, particularly those with a long history of supporting and conducting science, scored well, other responses indicate that some agencies have only taken a few steps towards implementing policies that comply with the memo. These results are of interest to the data curation community as they reveal how different agencies across the federal government approach their responsibilities for research data management, and how new policies and requirements might continue to affect scientists and research communities.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-06-14</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-027</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-027</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 27</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-027/680</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-027/681</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-027</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-027</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, there is a shortage of spontaneous speech corpora that are freely available for academics. We therefore undertook the building of a natural conversation speech database, recording over 200 hours of conversations in English by over 600 local university students. With few exceptions, the students used their own cell phones from their own rooms or homes to speak to one another, and they were permitted to speak on any topic they chose. Although they knew that they were being recorded and that they would receive a small payment, their conversations in the corpus are probably very close to being natural and spontaneous. This paper describes a detailed case study of the problems we faced and the methods we used to make the recordings and control the collection of these social science data on a limited budget.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-11-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.10-011</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.10-011</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); 42-51</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.10-011/74</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.10-011</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

At a minimum, the data are needed for change analysis. Likewise, most people would value efforts to ensure the preservation of the archived S&amp;amp;T data. Future generations will use analysis techniques not even considered today. Until recently, archiving and preserving these data were usually accomplished within existing infrastructures and budgets. As the volume of archived data increases, however, organizations charged with archiving S&amp;amp;T data will be increasingly challenged (U.S. General Accounting Office, 2002). The U.S. Geological Survey has had experience in this area and has developed strategies to deal with the mountain of land remote sensing data currently being managed and the tidal wave of expected new data. The Agency has dealt with archiving issues, such as selection criteria, purging, advisory panels, and data access, and has met with preservation challenges involving photographic and digital media. That experience has allowed the USGS to develop management approaches, which this paper outlines.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2003-10-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.159</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.2.159</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 2 (2003); 159-163</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.159/208</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.2.159</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, previous related studies on this field narrowed their research scopes into information type and information specification. This paper focuses on the verification and the tracing of information using an information dissemination platform and other Semantic Web-based services. Services on our platform include information dissemination services to support reliable information exchange among researchers and knowledge service to provide unrevealed information. The latter is also divided into the two: knowledgization using ontology and inference using a Semantic Web-based inference engine. This paper discusses how this platform supports instant knowledge addition and inference. We demonstrate our approach by constructing an ontology for national R&amp;amp;D reference information using 37,656 RDF triples from about 2,300 KISTI (Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information) outcomes. Three knowledge services including 'Communities of Practice', 'Researcher Tracing,' and 'Research Map' were implemented on our platform using a Jena framework. Our study shows that information dissemination platforms will make a meaningful contribution to the possibility of realizing a practical Semantic Web-based information dissemination platform.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-05-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S241</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S241</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S241-S249</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S241/406</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S241</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It is also a comprehensive systematic study through dynamic marks, integrated description, and retrieval of human society evolution and its causality dependant on the theory and methodology of digitization information. It aims at breaking the limitation of diachronic language attributed to the process of history cognition, summation, and recovery, addressing a possible scheme to fuse historical factors in relation to changing history, dynamically applying a multiplicity of results so that the discipline of world history can meet the needs of the information-equipped society of the 21st century. In this article, the author uses theoretical modelling methods, resulting in a blueprint of the quality issue, namely the Digital World History premise, and a paradigm for setting the foundation and scientific data strategy as a basis for its necessity.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S698</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S698</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S698-S714</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S698/487</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S698</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We began the project with a preferred solution, the Canonical Text Services URN model, which we validated for suitability for the corpus and compared it to other approaches, including HTTP URLs and Handles. The process of applying the CTS model to Coptic SCRIPTORIUM required an in-depth analysis that took into account the domain-specific scholarly research and citation practices, the structure of the textual data, and the data management workflow.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-11-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-013</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2016-013</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 13</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-013/608</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-013/609</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-013/156</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-013</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-013</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Major problems discussed were the lack of scalable applications, the lack of expertise in developing solutions, the lack of respect for or attention to big data problems, data volume growth exceeding Moore's Law, poorly scaling algorithms, and poor data quality and integration. More communication between users, developers, and researchers is sorely needed. A variety of future work to help all three groups was discussed, ranging from collecting challenge problems to connecting with particular industrial or academic sectors.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2012-03-18</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.012-010</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.012-010</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 11 (2012); 37-45</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.012-010/47</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.012-010</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Potential uses of the developed infrastructures include a broad range of applications in the cultural heritage domain, where the historical perspective is relevant, with potentially positive impacts on E-Education and E-Science.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.1.68</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.1.68</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 1, No 1 (2002); 68-83</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.1.68/175</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.1.68</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Previous studies have identified legal impediments to open access arising from intellectual property, confidentiality, privacy, national security, patent and tort laws. The legal impediments have not been fully addressed by public research funding agencies in Malaysia, thus the need for a model guidelines to be developed. This study conducted a comparative analysis of the  principles/policies/guidelines on open access to research data of the civil society, government bodies, research funding agencies and research institutions in Australia, Canada, the EU, the UK and the USA. This comparative analysis attempts to identify the appropriate measures to address the legal impediments to open access to research data. This model guidelines is of international standard and suitable for adoption by public research funding agencies and research institutions in Malaysia. Hence, the model guidelines can become a benchmark in pursuing the objective of enabling open access to publicly funded research data in Malaysia.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-06-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-027</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-027</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 27</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-027/853</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-027/854</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-027</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-027</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Understanding what users may, or may not, do with data in online data repositories is key to maximizing the benefits of scientific data re-use. Many online repositories that allow access to scientific data indicate that data is “open,” yet specific usage conditions reviewed on 40 “open” sites suggest that there is no agreed upon understanding of what “open” means with respect to data. This inconsistency can be an impediment to data re-use by researchers and the public.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-01-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-043</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-043</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 203-230</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-043/15</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-043</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This paper proposes new methods to identify those persons for the first time from their victory sign. These methods are based on features extracted from the fingers areas using shape moments in addition to other features related to fingers contours. To evaluate the proposed methods and to show the feasibility of this study we have created a victory sign database for 400 volunteers using a mobile phone camera. The experimental results using different classifiers show encouraging identification results; as the best precision/recall were achieved by merging normalized features from both methods using linear discriminate analysis classifier with 96.6% precision and 96.3 recall. Such a high performance achieved by the proposed methods shows their great potential to be applied for terrorists’ identification from their victory sign.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-10-15</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-027</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-027</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 27</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-027/785</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-027/786</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1007</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1008</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1009</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1010</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1011</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1012</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1013</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1014</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1015</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1016</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1017</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1018</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1224</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-027</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-027</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

While this attribute is well-known to professionals engaged in software engineering and computer interface design and testing, extension of the concept to embrace information would seem to be a new development. Furthermore, while notions such as the use and value of spatial information, and the diffusion of spatial information systems, have been the subject of research since the late-1980s, the current references to usability clearly represent something which extends well beyond that initial research. Accordingly, the purposes of this paper are: (1) to understand what is meant by spatial data usability; (2) to identify the elements that might comprise usability; and (3) to consider what the related research questions might be.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2003-02-26</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.79</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.2.79</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 2 (2003): Special Issue; 79-89</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.79/231</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.2.79</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The goal of this work is to extract classification rules from data. Swarm intelligence (SI) is a technique whereby rules may be discovered through the study of collective behavior in decentralized, self-organized systems, such as ants. The Ant-Miner algorithm, first proposed by Parpinelli and his colleagues (2002), applies an ant colony optimization (ACO) heuristic to the classification task of data mining to discover an ordered list of classification rules. Ant-Miner is a rule-induction algorithm that uses SI techniques to form rules. Ant-Miner uses a discretization process to deal with continuous attributes in the data. Discretization transforms numeric attributes into nominal attributes. Discretization may suffer from a loss of information, as the real relationship underlying individual values of a numeric attribute is unknown. The objective of this work is to apply ACO heuristic techniques to discover unordered rule sets for mixed variables in a data set. The proposed algorithm handles both nominal and continuous attributes using multimodal functions. It has the advantage of discovering more modular rules, i.e., rules that can be interpreted independently from other rules - unlike the rules in an ordered list, where the interpretation of a rule requires knowledge of the previous rules in the list. The results provide evidence that the accuracy of the Unordered Rule Set Continuous Ant-Miner algorithm is competitive with other Ant-Miner versions and generates simpler rule sets.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2008-05-27</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.76</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.7.76</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 7 (2008); 76-87</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.76/316</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.7.76</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We expect that the all Taiwanese fish species databank (RSD), with 2800+ species, and the digital \"Fish Fauna of Taiwan\" will be completed in 2007. Underwater ecological photos and video images for all 2,800+ fishes are quite difficult to achieve but will be collected continuously in the future. In the last year of NDAP, we have successfully integrated all fish specimen data deposited at 7 different institutes in Taiwan as well as their collection maps on the Google Map and Google Earth. Further, the database also provides the pronunciation of Latin scientific names and transliteration of Chinese common names by referring to the Romanization system for all Taiwanese fishes (2,902 species in 292 families so far). The Taiwanese fish species checklist with Chinese common/vernacular names and specimen data has been updated periodically and provided to the global FishBase as well as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) through the national portal of the Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF). Thus, Taiwanese fish data can be queried and browsed on the WWW. For contributing to the \"Barcode of Life\" and \"All Fishes\" international projects, alcohol-preserved specimens of more than 1,800 species and cryobanking tissues of 800 species have been accumulated at RCBAS in the past two years. Through this close collaboration between local and global databases, \"The Fish Database of Taiwan\" now attracts more than 250,000 visitors and achieves 5 million hits per month. We believe that this local database is becoming an important resource for education, research, conservation, and sustainable use of fish in Taiwan.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S164</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S164</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S164-S171</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S164/398</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S164</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, in \"small science\" domains, especially in field sciences such as archaeology, conservation, and public health, datasets often resist standardization. Publishing data in the small sciences should embrace this diversity rather than attempt to corral research into \"universal\" (domain) standards. A growing ecosystem of increasingly powerful Web syndication based approaches for sharing data on the public Web can offer a viable approach. Atom Feed based services can be used with scientific collections to identify and create linkages across different datasets, even across disciplinary boundaries without shared domain standards.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2010-06-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.009-012</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.009-012</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010); 42-53</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.009-012/124</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.009-012</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Special attention was paid to the structural behavior of SrZrO3 and the decomposition of K3TbBr6 at low temperature, respectively, to illustrate how to select an appropriate thermodynamic model based on crystal structure and chemistry information, how to identify and resolve the inconsistency between various kinds of experimental data, and how to use thermodynamic modeling as a basic tool in the development and optimization of materials and process. In the present work, different structures of SrZrO3 were explained by thermodynamic calculation and confirmed with experimental technologies. The decomposition of the compound K3TbBr6at about 593 K was detected by the present thermodynamic calculation and the new complementary experimental measurements. Comparison between the calculated and measured phase diagrams as well as thermodynamic quantities provided the final test of the overall consistency between the reliable experimental information and the present modeling and thermodynamic computation.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-08-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S420</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S420</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); dsj.6.S408</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S420/429</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S420</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The data was collected in an efficient and systematic way by long-term experiments and observations of black land and statistics information. It is based on the ORACLE database management system and the interface is written in PB language. The database has the following main facilities:(1) runs on Windows platforms; (2) facilitates data entry from *.dbf to ORACLE or creates ORACLE tables directly; (3)has a metadata facility that describes the methods used in the laboratory or in the observations; (4) data can be transferred to an expert system for simulation analysis and estimates made by Visual C++ and Visual Basic; (5) can be connected with GIS, so it is easy to analyze changes in land use ; and (6) allows metadata and data entity to be shared on the internet. The following datasets are included in CSDB_BL: long-term experiments and observations of water, soil, climate, biology, special research projects, and a natural resource survey of Hailun County in the 1980s; images from remote sensing, graphs of vectors and grids, and statistics from Northeast of China. CSDB_BL can be used in the research and evaluation of agricultural sustainability nationally, regionally, or locally. Also, it can be used as a tool to assist the government in planning for agricultural development.

Policies concerning the open access to research data try to implement new norms calling for researchers to make their data more openly available. These policies either appeal to the common good or focus on publication and citation as an incentive to bring about a cultural change in how researchers share their data with their peers. But when we compare the total number of publications in the fields of science, technology and medicine with the number data publications from the same time period, the number of openly available datasets is rather small. This indicates that current policies on data sharing are not effective in changing behaviours and bringing about the wanted cultural change. By looking at research communities that are more open to data sharing we can study the social patterns that influence data sharing and point us to possible points for intervention and change.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-014</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-014</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 14</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-014/652</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-014/653</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-014</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-014</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Several recent reports have discussed the issues around \"lost\" data sets: those which are intended to be shared but cannot be identified and utilized effectively because of insufficient associated metadata. Both problems are approaching critical levels in Canada and internationally, a situation that is unacceptable because these data sets are often generated as a result of public funding. Solutions may involve providing support and training for researchers on how they can best collect and manage their data sets or developing gateways to scientific data sets. NRC-CISTI is the largest comprehensive source of scientific, technical, and medical information in North America, with a mandate to serve as Canada's national science library. Through its publishing arm, NRC Research Press, it is also Canada's foremost scientific publisher. NRC-CISTI is an organization with demonstrated expertise in metadata management, which, until recently, focused primarily on library and publishing contexts. However in November 2007, it formally committed to expand its agenda to address the management of scientific research data and the related critical needs of the research community. This paper presents NRC-CISTI's activities in this area. NRC-CISTI has begun by hosting forums in which the critical players (including the granting agencies) mapped out targets and approaches. It has strengthened its own internal expertise regarding metadata and management of scientific data sets. Finally, NRC-CISTI is developing a gateway Web site which will provide access to Canadian scientific data sets and related metadata, tools, educational resources, and other informative and collaborative tools urgently needed by Canadian and international researchers. NRC-CISTI is the sponsoring body for the Canadian National Committee for CODATA and is committed to promoting and supporting CNC/CODATA's initiatives.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-03-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.27</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.8.27</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 27-33</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.27/199</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.8.27</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Forum, which was held in November 2004, brought together more than seventy Canadian leaders in scientific research, data management, research administration, intellectual property and other pertinent areas. This article presents a comprehensive review of the issues, and the opportunities and the challenges identified during the Forum. Complex and rich arrays of scientific databases are changing how research is conducted, speeding the discovery and creation of new concepts. Increased access will accelerate such changes even more, creating other new opportunities. With the combination of databases within and among disciplines and countries, fundamental leaps in knowledge will occur that will transform our understanding of life, the world and the universe. The Canadian research community is concerned by the need to take swift action to adapt to the substantial changes required by the scientific enterprise. Because no national data preservation organization exists, may experts believe that a national strategy on data access or policies needs to be developed, and that a \"Data Task Force\" be created to prepare a full national implementation strategy. Once such a national strategy is broadly supported, it is proposed that a dedicated national infrastructure, tentatively called \"Data Canada\", be established, to assume overall leadership in the development and execution of a strategic plan.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-06-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.OD26</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.OD26</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007): Special Issue; OD26-OD35</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.OD26/366</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.OD26</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

A large number of research groups and communities are building and developing data-driven workflows. However, much of the data and knowledge is stored in different heterogeneous data sources maintained by different groups. This leads to a reduced availability of the data and poor interoperability between systems in this domain. Ontology-based techniques are an important way to reduce these problems and a number of efforts have started. In this paper we investigate efforts in the materials science, and in particular in the nanotechnology domain, and show how such ontologies developed by domain experts, can be improved. We use a phrase-based topic model approach and formal topical concept analysis on unstructured text in this domain to suggest additional concepts and axioms for the ontology that should be validated by a domain expert. We describe the techniques and show the usefulness of the approach through an experiment where we extend two nanotechnology ontologies using approximately 600 titles and abstracts.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-10-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-050</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-050</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 50</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-050/900</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-050/901</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1772</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1773</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1774</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1775</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1776</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1777</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1885</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-050</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-050</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The theory of discrete mathematical analysis and collection of algorithms for time series processing constructed on its basis represents the results of this research direction. These algorithms are the consequence of fuzzy modeling of the logic of an interpreter who visually recognizes anomalies in records. They allow analyzing large data sets that are not subjected to manual processing. The efficiency of these algorithms is demonstrated in several important geophysical applications. Plans for an extension of the Russian INTERMAGNET segment are presented.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-02-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-019</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-019</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS114-WDS11</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-019/93</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-019</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The system is based on the University of Minnesota MapServer, an open source platform for publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web with MySQL as the backend database server. This paper discusses some of the details of the storage and organization of oceanographic data, methods employed for visualization of parameter plots, and mapping of the data. ODIS is conceived to be an end-to-end system comprising acquisition of data from a variety of heterogeneous ocean platforms, processing, integration, quality control, and web-based dissemination to users for operational and research activities. ODIS provides efficient data management and potential mapping and visualization functions for oceanographic data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-08-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-005</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.13-005</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013); 47-55</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-005/38</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.13-005</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We propose an algorithm for determining optimal patterns in data by separately training and testing three decision tree models in the Pima Indians Diabetes and the Bupa Liver Disorders datasets. Model performance is assessed using ROC curves and the Youden Index. Moving differences between sequential fitted parameters are then extracted, and their respective probability density estimations are used to track their variability using an iterative graphical data visualisation technique developed for this purpose. Our results show that the proposed strategy separates the groups more robustly than the plain ROC/Youden approach, eliminates obscurity, and minimizes over-fitting. Further, the algorithm can easily be understood by non-specialists and demonstrates multi-disciplinary compliance.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-05-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-045</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-045</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS247-WDS253</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-045/166</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-045</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The simple but comprehensive user interface of the system permits the entering of uncertain specifications in query forms. The system was modelled and simulated in a Matlab environment; its implementation was carried out using Borland C++ Builder. The result of the performance measure of the system using precision and recall rates is encouraging. Similarly, the smaller amount of more precise information retrieved by the system will positively impact the response time perceived by the users.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-09-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-038</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.007-038</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 233-242</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-038/250</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.007-038</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

These two forests were classified respectively by Decision No. 766-54/EF and No. 765-54/EF signed on July, 29th 1954 by the colonial authority. To date, there is still no legislative enactment that establishes Djamde’s reserve status. Since 2003, its management has been granted to TOGO-FAUNE Company.Different plant communities identified are: clear forests, gallery forests, shrubby savannas and a mosaic of wooded/tree savannas. The inventory of woody species carried out on circular plots, allowed to identify 126 ligneous species distributed in 40 botanical families and 94 genera. Eleven of these species are classified in the IUCN Red List with the status of “extinction risk”.The pressures on the biodiversity of Djamde’s reserve include poaching, wood fuel production and vegetation fires. Aim of this project is to create an Ecological Corridor between Wildlife Reserve and Sarakawa’s Park and to promote public-private partnership in protected area management.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-05-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-018</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-018</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 18</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-018/835</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-018/836</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-018/1340</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-018/1341</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-018/1342</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-018</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-018</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Kozah prefecture (Kara region in northern Togo) - Togo, West Africa</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">May 5, 2014 - May 20, 2018</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0 License</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This bias was of the order 10° and persisted from November 2008 to January 2010, which was consistent with a post-recovery calibration drift in the anemometer vane. Unfortunately, the calibration drift was too time-variant to be used to correct the data so the quality flag for this deployment was adjusted to reflect low data quality. The primary purpose of this paper is to inform users in the modelling and remote-sensing community about this systematic, persistent wind directional bias, which will allow users to make an educated decision on using the data and be aware of its potential impact to their downstream product quality. The uncovering of this bias and its source demonstrates the importance of continuous scientific oversight and effective user-data provider communication in stewarding scientific data. It also suggests the need for improvement in the ability of buoy data quality control procedures of the TAO and ECMWF systems to detect future wind directional systematic biases such as the one described here.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-07-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-019</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-019</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 79-87</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-019/6</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-019</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

With the development of national educational objectives in four disciplines an important basis for the implementation of this constitutional mandate was created. In 2013 the Swiss National Core Skills Assessment Program (in German: ÜGK – Überprüfung der Grundkompetenzen) was initiated to investigate the skills of students, starting with three of four domains: mathematics, language of teaching and first foreign language in grades 2, 6 and 9. ÜGK uses a computer-based test and a sample size of 25.000 students per year. A huge challenge for computer-based educational assessment is the research data management process. Data from several different systems and tools existing in different formats has to be merged to obtain data products researchers can utilize. The long term preservation has to be adapted as well. In this paper, we describe our current processes and data sources as well as our ideas for enhancing the data management.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-07-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-018</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-018</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 18</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-018/767</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-018/768</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-018</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-018</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Switzerland</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Starting in 1991, the journal Nucleic Acids Research published an annual Database Issue dedicated to articles describing molecular biology databases. Analysis of these articles reveals a set of long-lived databases which have remained available for more than 15 years. Given the pervasive challenge of sustaining community resources, these databases provide an opportunity to examine what factors contribute to persistence by addressing two questions 1) which organizations fund these long-lived databases? and 2) which organizations maintain these long-lived databases? Funding and operating organizations for 67 databases were determined through review of Database Issue articles. The results reveal a diverse set of contributing organizations with financial and operational support spread across six categories: academic, consortium/collective, government, industry, philanthropic, and society/association. The majority of databases reported support from more than one funding organization, of which government organizations were most common source of funds. Operational responsibilities were more distributed, with academic organizations serving as the most common hosts. Although there is evidence of diversification overall, the most acknowledged funding and operating organizations contribute to disproportionately large percentages of the long-lived databases investigated here.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-03-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-008</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-008</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 8</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-008/939</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-008/940</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-008/1970</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-008/1971</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-008/1972</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-008/1973</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-008</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-008</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">1991-2016</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The challenge is to objectively integrate digital resources based on user-defined objectives for the purpose of discovering information relationships that facilitate interpretations and decision making. The Antarctic Treaty Searchable Database (http://aspire.nvi.net), which is in its sixth edition, provides an example of digital integration based on the automated generation of information granules that can be dynamically combined to reveal objective relationships within and between digital information resources. This case study further demonstrates that automated granularity and dynamic integration can be accomplished simply by utilizing the inherent structure of the digital information resources. Such information integration is relevant to library and archival programs that require long-term preservation of authentic digital resources.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-06-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.84</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.84</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 84-99</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.84/461</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.84</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

One of the activity is the provision of seasonal and medium-range climate forecasts to enable decisions concerning livestock herding. Seasonal weather forecasts are critical but there are challenges of timeliness and usability of the forecasts. The challenges are associated with the multiplicity of information sources, methods for data integration and dissemination channels. Institutions including public and Civil Society Organizations usually invest in collecting weather and other data which should be accessible. Often times this data remains hoarded necessitating other organizations to collect similar data. The inter-institutional relations notwithstanding, the lack of data sharing leads to minimal data available for open access. This paper illustrates that this challenge can be addressed by using combined multiple methods to elicit data on weather and other biophysical conditions for pastoralism in Karamoja. In this paper we additionally analyse the opportunities and challenges of using multiple sources of pastoral-relevant data to couple with weather information in support of herding decisions. Building resilient pastoralism that utilizes pasture and water availability will have to utilize available data. It is evident that more robust approaches for data sharing at global, regional and local levels are needed to understand how pastoralists can respond to climate shocks and changes. The paper illustrates the use of a multifaceted-methods approach including open data to develop climate forecast information for risk-reduction oriented information for decision-making. Integration of this data provides insights on how pastoralists have long adapted to a variable and changing climate, the methods and processes of adaptation to losses and damages from the climate shocks.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-11-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-050</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-050</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 50</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-050/727</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-050/728</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/428</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/429</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/740</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/741</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/742</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/743</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/744</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/745</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-050</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-050</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Sub-region of Northeastern Uganda</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Calibration and validation are very important for more accurate satellite products and can contribute to the detection of climate changes on earth. Calibration and validation of satellite products normally use both ground-based and satellite-based data, which have geospatial metainformation and various data policies. Our proposal adopts both the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards and the virtual organization (VO) concept to develop a calibration and validation system for satellite products. In this research, we construct the Field Observation Network (FON) VO, which provides an interoperable system for various ground-based and satellite-based data by using the OGC standards Sensor Observation Service (SOS). FON VO also makes it possible to protect data policies. Ground-based and satellite-based atmospheric and ground physical parameters are the focus of this study.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2010-01-27</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.SS_IGY-015</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.SS_IGY-015</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009): Special Issue; PIGY21-IGY31</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.SS_IGY-015/274</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.SS_IGY-015</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It is a critical step towards meeting U.S. federal regulations, organizational requirements, and user needs. However, it is challenging to do so consistently and quantifiably. The Data Stewardship Maturity Matrix (DSMM), developed jointly by NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites–North Carolina (CICS-NC), provides a uniform framework for consistently rating stewardship maturity of individual datasets in nine key components: preservability, accessibility, usability, production sustainability, data quality assurance, data quality control/monitoring, data quality assessment, transparency/traceability, and data integrity. So far, the DSMM has been applied to over 800 individual datasets that are archived and/or managed by NCEI, in support of the NOAA’s OneStop Data Discovery and Access Framework Project. As a part of the OneStop-ready process, tools, implementation guidance, workflows, and best practices are developed to assist the application of the DSMM and described in this paper. The DSMM ratings are also consistently captured in the ISO standard-based dataset-level quality metadata and citable quality descriptive information documents, which serve as interoperable quality information to both machine and human end-users. These DSMM implementation and integration workflows and best practices could be adopted by other data management and stewardship projects or adapted for applications of other maturity assessment models.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-08-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-041</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-041</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 41</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-041/882</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-041/883</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-041/1808</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-041</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-041</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The instrument, based on ring core fluxgate magnetometer technology, improves the field environment performance. Using wireless technology provides on-the-spot mobile networking for the observational data, with efficient access to the earthquake precursor observation network. It provides a powerful detection method for earthquake short-term prediction through installation of a low-noise fluxgate magnetometer array, intensely observing the phenomenon of geomagnetic disturbances and abnormal low-frequency electromagnetic signals in different latitudes, then carrying out observational data processing and exploring the relationship between earthquake activity and geomagnetic field changes.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-06-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-05</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-05</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); IAGA25-IAGA33</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Our approach to Arctic Ocean boundary measurements is generating significant scientific outcomes. However, it is not always easy to access Arctic data. On the basis of our last five years’ experience of assembling pan-Arctic boundary data, and considering the success of Argo, I propose that Arctic data policy should be driven by specific scientific-based requirements. Otherwise, it will be hard to implement the International Polar Year data policy. This approach would also help to establish a consensus of future Arctic science.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-10-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-12</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-12</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014): Special Issue; PDA72-PDA78</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-12/29</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-12</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This means that researchers now have ways of making their data available, but not necessarily incentives to do so. Several Research Data Alliance (RDA) working groups have been working on ways to start measuring activities around research data to provide input for new Data Level Metrics (DLMs). These DLMs are a critical step towards providing researchers with credit for their work. In this paper, we describe the outcomes of the work of the Scholarly Link Exchange (Scholix) working group and the Data Usage Metrics working group. The Scholix working group developed a framework that allows organizations to expose and discover links between articles and datasets, thereby providing an indication of data citations. The Data Usage Metrics group works on a standard for the measurement and display of Data Usage Metrics. Here we explain how publishers and data repositories can contribute to and benefit from these initiatives. Together, these contributions feed into several hubs that enable data repositories to start displaying DLMs. Once these DLMs are available, researchers are in a better position to make their data count and be rewarded for their work.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-03-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-009</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 9</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-009/817</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-009/818</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-009/1202</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-009/1203</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-009/1204</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-009/1390</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-009/1391</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-009</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-009</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It focuses on the complexity of the social and economic challenges created by climate change and the demographic explosion and the difficulty of confronting them in the absence of an adequate digital infrastructure. Although a well-coordinated, federated multi-state open science system would be a means of overcoming this barrier, African science systems largely operate independently of each other, creating siloes of incompatible policies, practices and data sets that are not mutually consistent or inter-operable. Africa’s linguistic chasms of English, French, Portuguese, Spanish and indigenous languages create further barriers. As international science moves towards greater openness and data sharing to address the complexity inherent in major global challenges, Africa’s stance needs radical overhaul. The paper draws on the questionnaire data from 15 African Science Granting Councils and the state-of-the-art Report to them on “Open Science in Research and Innovation for Development in Africa”. It concludes that a well-developed Open Science system for Africa, would develop and enhance collaborations and partnerships among Africans to tackle the challenges that they face and accelerate innovation and development.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-08-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-031</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-031</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 31</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-031/986</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-031/987</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-031/2330</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-031/2331</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-031/2332</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-031/2333</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-031/2334</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-031/2335</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-031/2336</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-031</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-031</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">13 African countries in the 15 member  Science Granting Council Initiative</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Chronological coverage</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Gender, Age, Educational experience, Level of responsibility</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It is based on FAIR Data Stewardship, in which each data-related decision in a project acts to optimize the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and/or Reusability of the data. The background to this philosophy is that the first reuser of the data is the researcher themselves. The tool encourages the consulting of expertise and experts, can help researchers avoid risks they did not know they would encounter by confronting them with practical experience from others, and can help them discover helpful technologies they did not know existed.In this paper, we discuss the context and motivation for the tool, we explain its architecture and we present key functions, such as the knowledge model evolvability and migrations, assembling data management plans, metrics and evaluation of data management plans.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-12-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-059</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-059</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 59</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-059/919</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-059/920</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-059/1458</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-059/1459</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-059/1460</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-059/1461</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-059/1462</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-059/1652</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-059</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-059</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">World-wide</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">N/A</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">N/A</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

One of the main objectives of the SFEMSs is to detect the geomagnetic secular variations on the deep seafloor where long-term geomagnetic observations have not so far been achieved. SFEMSs can measure the absolute geomagnetic total force as well as the geomagnetic vector field with precise attitude monitoring systems. The vector geomagnetic time-series that was observed for more than 5 years revealed that the westward drift of the equatorial dipole dominates in the geomagnetic secular variation at the NWP.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2010-03-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.SS_IGY-004</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.SS_IGY-004</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010): Special Issue; IGY100-IGY109</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.SS_IGY-004/147</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.SS_IGY-004</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This led to the adoption of key agreements such as the Sustainable Development Goals. In this regard, it is important to identify and evaluate under-recognized disaster risks that hinder sustainable development: measures to mitigate climate change are the same as those that build resilience against climate-related disasters. To do this we need to advance scientific and technical knowledge, build data infrastructure that allows us to predict events with greater accuracy, and develop data archives. For this reason we have developed the Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS). DIAS incorporates analysis, data and models from many fields and disciplines. It collects and stores data from satellites, ground observation stations and numerical weather prediction models; integrates this data with geographical and socio-economic information; then generates results for crisis management of global environmental issues. This article gives an overview of DIAS and summarizes its application to climate change analysis and disaster risk reduction.

A successful GRDI will require a common globally interoperable distributed data system, formed out of data centres, that incorporates emerging technologies and new scientific data activities. The main challenge is to define common certification and auditing frameworks that will allow storage providers and data communities to build a viable partnership based on trust. To achieve this, it is necessary to find a long-term commitment model that will give financial, legal, and organisational guarantees of digital information preservation. In this article we discuss the state of the art in data storage and management for GRDIs and point out future research directions that need to be tackled to implement GRDIs.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-07-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-007</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-007</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; GRDI37-GRDI42</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-007/222</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-007</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

By high pressure, electric charge is created on the surface and at the center of the earth. Inner core rotation yields a magnetic field. From the intensity and direction of geomagnetism at the present time, the surface charge density of the inner core is assumed to be -2x10-5C/m2. The rotation axis of the inner core is inclined by 10.4 degrees from that of the mantle. The inner core rotates with the mantle rotation. The reason for this is thought to be the eddy currents induced in the outer core of electrically conductive fluid that rotates with the mantle.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-06-13</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IGY-016</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IGY-016</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); S96-S101</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IGY-016/307</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IGY-016</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

For practical purposes, we estimate the risk of low dose radiation by extrapolating the effects at high doses to low doses in a linear relationship. However, several lines of evidence have accumulated in recent years that suggest this linear extrapolation is not necessarily correct and needs further scientific evaluation. Today, many scientists in the field are striving to understand the biological responses to low dose radiation. This work will provide new and perhaps convincing data which are necessary for risk estimation of low dose radiation. Here, I overview the background of the issue.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S99</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S99</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S99-S103</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S99/389</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S99</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Informatics is a new methodology for data intensive science, which is a new concept based on the fact that most scientific data are digitalized and the amount of data is huge. The facilities to support informatics are cloud systems. Herein we propose a cloud system especially designed for science. The basic concepts, design, resources, implementation, and applications of the NICT science cloud are discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-03-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-024</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-024</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS139-WDS146</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-024/115</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-024</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Based on this method, we have developed a model management application that has the following major functions: model management, model sort management, model query, model statistics, model registration into database as a whole, etc. With this method, researchers can manage model data conveniently and efficiently.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S797</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S797</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S797-S805</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S797/501</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S797</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Persistent identifiers were invented to address challenges arising from the distributed and disorganised nature of the internet, which often resulted in URLs to internet endpoints becoming invalid. Over the years several different persistent identifier systems have been applied to the identification of research data, not all with the same level of success in terms of uptake and sustainability. We investigate the uptake of persistent identifier systems and discuss the factors that might determine the stability and longevity of these systems. Persistent identifiers have become essential elements of global research data infrastructures. Understanding the factors that influence the stability and longevity of persistent identifier systems will help us guide the future development of this important element of research data infrastructures and will make it easier to adapt to future technological and organisational changes.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-03-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-009</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 9</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-009/640</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-009/641</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-009</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-009</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The DSJ received the paper in this section in 2011. The anonymous reviews of this submission were so constructive and informative that the Editors decided to ask the reviewers and the authors if we could publish the reviews, the authors’ responses, and the revised paper as one special section. All parties agreed. The Editors think that the conversation contained in the reviews and the author responses provides context for the paper as well as contributing to the world-wide conversations on sharing research data that are going on among researchers, policy makers, educators, and the general public (Arzberger, et al., 2004; Schofield, et al., 2009).

The traditional library resource sharing which still at the mode of information island is unable to maximize the use of resources. In order to solve this problem, this study designed a library information resources co-construction and sharing system based on Squid reverse proxy technology. After the system was completed, the login function, user opening function and resource sharing function were tested. Functions of the system were basically normal, but some small details affected users’ experience. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the system code before putting it into use. Moreover in the aspect of resource sharing, the system realized the login of the same user information into different library databases, and users can search same resources in different libraries.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-12-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-032</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-032</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 32</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-032/799</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-032/800</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-032/1237</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-032/1238</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-032/1239</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-032/1240</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-032/1241</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-032/1242</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-032</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-032</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This paper describes some aspects of VESPA at the end of this 4-years development phase and at the onset of the newly selected Europlanet-2024 programme starting in 2020. The main objectives of VESPA are to facilitate searches both in big archives and in small databases, to enable data analysis by providing simple data access and online visualization functions, and to allow research teams to publish derived data in an interoperable environment as easily as possible. VESPA encompasses a wide scope, including surfaces, atmospheres, magnetospheres and planetary plasmas, small bodies, heliophysics, exoplanets, and spectroscopy in solid phase. This system relies in particular on standards and tools developed for the Astronomy VO (IVOA) and extends them where required to handle specificities of Solar System studies. It also aims at making the VO compatible with tools and protocols developed in different contexts, for instance GIS for planetary surfaces, or time series tools for plasma-related measurements. An essential part of the activity is to publish a significant amount of high-quality data in this system, with a focus on derived products resulting from data analysis or simulations.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-05-11</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-022</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-022</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 22</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-022/946</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-022/947</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-022/1411</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-022/1412</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-022/1413</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-022/1414</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-022/1415</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-022/1416</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-022/2190</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-022/2191</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-022/2192</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-022</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-022</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Solar System</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Modern</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

I was looking forward to the future in this new exciting discipline when the head of my department, an internationally known professor, advised me that data was “a low level activity” not suitable for an academic. I recall my dismay. What can we do to ensure that this does not happen again and that data science is universally recognized as a worthwhile academic activity? Incidentally, I did not take that advice, or I would not be writing this essay, but moved into computer science.

Therefore it is very useful to identify the multidisciplinary data usage in the research of disaster events. In order to discover the correlation between multidisciplinary data and disaster research, three earthquake events, the Tangshan earthquake, the Wenchuan earthquake, and the Haidi earthquake were selected as typical study cases for this paper. A knowledge model for literature data mining was applied to analyze the correlation between earthquake events and multidisciplinary data types. The results indicate that high-cited papers show different data usage trends when compared with whole-set papers and also that data usage for the three earthquake events varies. According to analysis results, the factors that influence multidisciplinary data usage include the characteristics of spatial and temporal elements as well as differing interests of the data users.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-019</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-019</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 19</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-019/570</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-019/571</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-019</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-019</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The 16 funded VO projects have established the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (http://www.ivoa.net/) to develop the standard interoperable interfaces such as registry (meta data), data access, query languages, output format (VOTable), data model, application interface, and so on. The IVOA members have constructed each VO environment through the IVOA interfaces. National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) started its VO project (Japanese Virtual Observatory - JVO) in 2002, and developed its VO system. We have succeeded to interoperate the latest JVO system with other VOs in the USA and Europe since December 2004. Observed data by the Subaru telescope, satellite data taken by the JAXA/ISAS, etc. are connected to the JVO system. Successful interoperation of the JVO system with other VOs means that astronomers in the world will be able to utilize top-level data obtained by these telescopes from anywhere in the world at anytime. System design of the JVO system, experiences during our development including problems of current standard protocols defined in the IVOA, and proposals to resolve these problems in the near future are described.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2010-03-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IGY-050</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IGY-050</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010); S128-S134</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IGY-050/138</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IGY-050</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Decision Cube offers an easy path to powerful data analysis in an application. This paper describes a simple approach for data mining using the Decision Cube components of Delphi. It requires only some drag-and-dropping and property-setting, with no need for manual coding. It does not require special knowledge of data mining.

Since the emergence of molecular approaches, many biologists have focused their research, and related methods and instruments for data production, on the study of genes and genomes. While this trend is now shifting, prominent institutions and companies with stakes in molecular biology continue to set standards for what counts as ‘good science’ worldwide, resulting in the use of specific data production technologies as proxy for assessing data quality. This is problematic considering (1) the variability in research cultures, goals and the very characteristics of biological systems, which can give rise to countless different approaches to knowledge production; and (2) the existence of research environments that produce high-quality, significant datasets despite not availing themselves of the latest technologies. Ethnographic research carried out in such environments evidences a widespread fear among researchers that providing extensive information about their experimental set-up will affect the perceived quality of their data, making their findings vulnerable to criticisms by better-resourced peers. These fears can make scientists resistant to sharing data or describing their provenance. To counter this, debates around Open Data need to include critical reflection on how data quality is evaluated, and the extent to which that evaluation requires a localised assessment of the needs, means and goals of each research environment.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-06-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-032</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-032</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 32</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-032/690</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-032/691</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-032</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-032</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper, we propose a visual similarity based search engine for 3D objects. The system is based on a new representation of 3D objects given by a 3D closed curve that captures all information about the surface of the 3D object. We propose a new 3D descriptor, which is a combination of three signatures of this new representation, and we implement it in our interactive web based search engine. Our method is compared to some state of the art methods, tested using the Princeton-Shape Benchmark as a large database of 3D objects. The experimental results show that the enhanced curve analysis descriptor performs well.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-04-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-069</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.007-069</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 78-87</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-069/213</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.007-069</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

When a climatologists need to know the days of a specific pressure pattern, for example \"low pressure in Western areas of Japan and high pressure in Eastern areas of Japan (Japanese winter-type weather),\" they have to visually check a huge number of surface weather charts. To overcome this problem, we propose an automatic classification system using a support vector machine (SVM), which is a machine-learning method. We attempted to classify pressure patterns into two classes: \"winter type\" and \"non-winter type\". For both training datasets and test datasets, we used the JRA-25 dataset from 1981 to 2000. An experimental evaluation showed that our method obtained a greater than 0.8 F-measure. We noted that variations in results were based on differences in training datasets.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-04-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.S59</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.8.S59</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); S59-S67</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.S59/298</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.8.S59</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Data have been collected and stored in electronic databases since at least the 1940s. These databases are owned by many organizations around the world. In addition, the anthropometric studies stored in these databases often employ different standards, terminology, procedures, or measurement sets. To promote the use and sharing of these databases, the World Engineering Anthropometry Resources (WEAR) group was formed and tasked with the integration and publishing of member resources. It is easy to see that organizing worldwide anthropometric data into a single database architecture could be a daunting and expensive undertaking. The challenges of WEAR integration reflect mainly in the areas of distributed and disparate data, different standards and formats, independent memberships, and limited development resources. Fortunately, XML schema and web services provide an alternative method for networking databases, referred to as the Loosely Coupled WEAR Integration. A standard XML schema can be defined and used as a type of Rosetta stone to translate the anthropometric data into a universal format, and a web services system can be set up to link the databases to one another. In this way, the originators of the data can keep their data locally along with their own data management system and user interface, but their data can be searched and accessed as part of the larger data network, and even combined with the data of others. This paper will identify requirements for WEAR integration, review XML as the universal format, review different integration approaches, and propose a hybrid web services/data mart solution.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S18</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S18</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S18-S27</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S18/380</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S18</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Primary difficulties are the long term stability of sensor orientation and the stable operation of the sensor system. In standard practice, definitive data are produced through the combination of continuous operation of a variometer and the occasional absolute measurements that are used for calibration of the variometer data. A single, automatic instrument that can continuously acquire absolute vector measurements with 1-second resolution is desired. We introduce a device that will fulfil these requirements. Data are acquired using Serson's method: the ambient magnetic field is modulated by superposed fields. This method has been applied, mostly in connection with Proton magnetometers, for many years. In general it requires that the applied fields have a strength on the order of the Earth's magnetic field. But the sampling rate is limited for most xisting systems. In contrast, our system only requires applied fields of about 5000nT, and the switching rate of polarities is 5Hz. This is possible because we use a fast self oscillating Cs-magnetometer. The self oscillating Cs-magnetometer is calibrated by a Cs-He cell during times without additional fields (tandem-magnetometer).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-07-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-18</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-18</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); IAGA109-IAGA116</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-18/107</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-18</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Assessing the risks of low-dose radiation, i.e. radiation-induced cancer, is becoming important in the study of public health because of the many different types of exposures, medical exposures, and from radiation protection viewpoints. In general, radiation effects arise from damage done to DNA by ionizing radiation. Therefore, examining effects from the initial DNA damage to the risk assessment is a problem with a very wide spatiotemporal scale. We are studying this problem by dividing it into three parts: 1) the DNA strand is broken by ionizing radiation, 2) DNA lesion repair, and 3) the process of cell carcinogenesis and tumorigenesis. In this paper, we mainly focus on the third part, the study of modeling and simulation of cell carcinogenesis.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-05-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S278</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S278</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S278-S284</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S278/411</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S278</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

By measuring the brain's response to such events, we can learn how different types of information are processed. As the mass of recorded ERP data explodes, an automatic and accurate tool to store, manage, and retrieve data readily is of increasing concern in neuroinformatics. In this paper, we describe a relational ERP database that has been constructed using the SQL server 2000 database management system and an IIS web server that has been setup for data retrieval through a custom web interface (http://202.113.232.103:8088/erpdb/index.asp). A novel database structure has been used to store ERP data of different activity channels, which provides a rapid and accurate way for data retrieval within any given range on the time zone with various searching options. The database is divided into: (1) subjects' information and record information and (2) ERP data, which has been structured and standardized in a database table supplemented with unrestricted text files. It can integrate or exchange data with other clinical databases or computer-based information systems through a program based on ADO techniques. Users are able to readily retrieve ERP data through the user-friendly web page interface. All online resources of the database are freely available to the scientific community. As the database develops further, we anticipate it will become a valuable tool that will make a great contribution to everyday clinical practice, teaching, and research work inneuroscience and psychology in the future.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S743</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S743</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S743-S748</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S743/492</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S743</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This becomes one of the most important and widely discussed issues in the data science community. The system analysis methods and data mining techniques are able to sustain the solution of this problem. This paper presents an innovative holistic hardware/software system (HSS) developed for efficient management and intellectual analysis of geomagnetic data, registered by Russian geomagnetic observatories and international satellites. Geomagnetic observatories that comprise the International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network (INTERMAGNET) produce preliminary (raw) and definitive (corrected) geomagnetic data of the highest quality. The designed system automates and accelerates routine production of definitive data from the preliminary magnetograms, obtained by Russian observatories, due to implemented algorithms that involve artificial intelligence elements. The HSS is the first system that provides sophisticated automatic detection and multi-criteria classification of extreme geomagnetic conditions, which may be hazardous for technological infrastructure and economic activity in Russia. It enables the online access to digital geomagnetic data, its processing results and modelling calculations along with their visualization on conventional and spherical screens. The concept of the presented system agrees with the accepted ‘four Vs’ paradigm of Big Data. The HSS can increase significantly the ‘velocity’ and ‘veracity’ features of the INTERMAGNET system. It also provides fusion of large sets of ground-based and satellite geomagnetic data, thus facilitating the ‘volume’ and ‘variety’ of handled data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-12-16</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-018</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2016-018</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 18</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-018/618</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-018/619</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/266</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/267</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/268</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/269</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/270</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/271</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/272</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/273</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/274</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/275</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/276</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/277</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/278</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/279</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/280</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/281</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/282</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/283</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/284</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-018</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-018</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Territory of the Russian Federation</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Unsatisfactory modeling can be ascribed to incomplete collateral data, i.e, to the fact that there is insufficient data known about the behavior of these compounds in solution. This is usually because intermolecular forces cannot be modeled. The anomalous modeling can be detected from the rather large values of the standard deviation of the estimates of the whole set of compounds, and from the unsatisfactory modeling of some of the subsets of these compounds. Thus the detected abnormalities can be used (i) to get an idea about weak intermolecular interactions such as hydration, self-association, the hydrogen-bond phenomena in solution, and (ii) to reshape the molecular descriptors with the introduction of parameters that allow better modeling. This last procedure should be used with care, bearing in mind that the solubility phenomena is rather complex.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.1.203</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.1.203</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 1, No 2 (2002); 203-215</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.1.203/180</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.1.203</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Research has shown that with today’s computational power and advanced machine learning algorithms it is possible to build models to predict bookings cancellation likelihood. However, the effectiveness of these models has never been evaluated in a real environment. To fill this gap and investigate how these models can be implemented in a decision support system and its impact on demand-management decisions, a prototype was built and deployed in two hotels. The prototype, based on an automated machine learning system designed to learn continuously, lead to two important research contributions. First, the development of a training method and weighting mechanism designed to capture changes in cancellations patterns over time and learn from previous days’ predictions hits and errors. Second, the creation of a new measure – Minimum Frequency – to measure the precision of predictions over time. From a business standpoint, the prototype demonstrated its effectiveness, with results exceeding 84% in accuracy, 82% in precision, and 88% in Area Under the Curve (AUC). The system allowed hotels to predict their net demand and thus making better decisions about which bookings to accept and reject, what prices to make, and how many rooms to oversell. The systematic prediction of bookings with high probability of being canceled allowed hotels to reduce cancellations by 37 percentage points by acting to avoid their cancellation.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-07-08</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-032</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-032</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 32</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-032/863</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-032/864</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-032/1312</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-032/1313</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-032/1314</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-032/1315</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-032/1316</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-032/1317</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-032/1318</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-032/1319</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-032</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-032</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Portuguese hotels</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">2015 to 2017</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Hotel booking data for the period covered</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, there is still a long way to go, especially in terms of raising researcher recognition for improving data registration and sharing.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-09-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-03</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-03</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014): Special Issue; PDA15-PDA19</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-03/20</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IFPDA-03</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

These patterns can be utilized for clinical diagnosis. However, the available raw medical data are widely distributed, heterogeneous in nature, and voluminous. These data need to be collected in an organized form. This collected data can be then integrated to form a hospital information system. Data mining technology provides a user-oriented approach to novel and hidden patterns in the data. Data mining and statistics both strive towards discovering patterns and structures in data. Statistics deals with heterogeneous numbers only, whereas data mining deals with heterogeneous fields. We identify a few areas of healthcare where these techniques can be applied to healthcare databases for knowledge discovery. In this paper we briefly examine the impact of data mining techniques, including artificial neural networks, on medical diagnostics.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-11-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.119</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.119</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 119-126</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.119/467</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.119</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, research on the intelligent interpretation of such images is insufficient partly because of their the complexity and large size. In this study, a high spatial resolution remote sensing image intelligent interpretation system (HSR-RSIIIs) was designed with image segmentation, a geographical information system, and a data-mining algorithm. Some key methods such as image segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification algorithm for interpreting high spatial resolution remote sensing image have been studied. A land cover classification experiment was performed in the Zhuzhou area using a Quickbird multi-spectral image. The classification results were consistent with the visual interpretation results. In additional, the proposed interpretation method was compared with the traditional pixel-based method. The results indicate that the method proposed in the literature is more effective and intelligent than that used previously.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-08-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S445</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S445</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S445-S452</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S445/434</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S445</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It derives from the sentence category of the HNC theory and corresponding techniques. It can start with a few texts, and it can adjust automatically or be adjusted by user. The user can also control the number of domains chosen and decide the standard with which to choose the texts based on demand and abundance of materials.

Among persistent identifiers, Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) stand out quite prominently, with approximately 133 million DOIs assigned to various objects as of February 2017. While the assignment of DOIs to objects such as scientific publications has been in place for many years, their assignment to Earth science data sets is more recent. Applying persistent identifiers to data sets enables improved tracking of their use and reuse, facilitates the crediting of data producers, and aids reproducibility through associating research with the exact data set(s) used. Maintaining provenance – i.e., tracing back lineage of significant scientific conclusions to the entities (data sets, algorithms, instruments, satellites, etc.) that lead to the conclusions, would be prohibitive without persistent identifiers. This paper provides a brief background on the use of persistent identifiers in general within the US, and DOIs more specifically. We examine their recent use for Earth science data sets, and outline successes and some remaining challenges. Among the challenges, for example, is the ability to conveniently and consistently obtain data citation statistics using the DOIs assigned by organizations that manage data sets.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-023</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-023</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 23</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-023/671</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-023/673</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-023/255</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-023</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-023</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">n/a</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">n/a</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">n/a</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Properly selected data mining techniques enable researchers to process and analyze massive amounts of data collected by satellites and other instruments. Large spatial-temporal datasets can be analyzed using different linear and nonlinear methods. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a promising tool for clustering and visualizing high dimensional data and mapping spatial-temporal datasets describing nonlinear phenomena. We present results of the application of the SOM technique in regions of interest within the European re-analysis data set. The possibility of detecting climate change signals through the visualization capability of SOM tools is examined.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-05-11</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.009-004</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.009-004</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); 1-12</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.009-004/70</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.009-004</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Moreover, scientific work environments and research data infrastructures are based on a wide range of different technical architectures; this hampers the exchange of data among systems. In most cases, the research data infrastructures that are currently in operation remain isolated data silos that supply scientists with the data the systems were designed to deliver but do not allow scientists to discover all data that is available world-wide on a topic or to discover data on related topics provided by a different research data infrastructure.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-07-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-002</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-002</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; GRDI6-GRDI12</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-002/204</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-002</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Limitations of pre-existing options led to the creation of MathML. MathML is designed to be useful for authoring and publishing, for creating online interactive math resources, and as a non-proprietary approach for archiving. MathML is supported by the W3C and by multiple scholarly publishers and vendors of computer-based mathematics software. The question now is whether MathML can achieve greater acceptance among authors and better integration with standards in related domains, either through cross-walks or through direct incorporation into other domain schemas.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-11-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.209</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006): Special Issue; 209-218</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.209/484</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Low back pain is prevalent in society yet few validated 3D models of the lumbar spine exist to facilitate assessment. We therefore created a 3D surface data set for lumbar vertebrae from human vertebrae. Models from 86 lumbar vertebrae were constructed using an inexpensive method involving image capture by digital camera and reconstruction of 3D models via an image-based technique. The reconstruction method was validated using a laser-based arm scanner and measurements derived from real vertebrae using electronic callipers. Results show a mean relative error of 5.2% between image-based models and real vertebrae, a mean relative error of 4.7% between image-based and arm scanning models and 95% of vertices’ errors are less than 3.5 millimetres with a median of 1.1 millimetres. The accuracy of the method indicates that the generated models could be useful for biomechanical modelling or 3D visualisation of the spine.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-08-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2016-009</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 9</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/Array</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-009/600</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-009/601</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/5</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/6</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/7</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/8</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/9</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/10</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/11</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/12</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/13</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/14</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/15</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/16</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/17</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/18</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-009</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-009</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess</dc:rights><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

These functionalities are critical for addressing a number of key issues faced by data collectors and users, including trust in data, results traceability, data transparency, and data citation support. In this paper, we describe the support for these services within the Data Conservancy Service (DCS) software.

While centralised research data support units now exist in many universities, these typically possess neither the discipline-specific expertise nor the resources to offer appropriate targeted training and support within every academic unit. One solution to this problem is to identify suitable individuals with discipline-specific expertise that are already embedded within each unit, and empower these individuals to advocate for good RDM and to deliver support locally. This article focuses on an ongoing example of this approach: the Data Champion Programme at the University of Cambridge, UK. We describe how the Data Champion programme was established; the programme’s reach, impact, strengths and weaknesses after two years of operation; and our anticipated challenges and planned strategies for maintaining the programme over the medium- and long-term.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-06-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-023</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-023</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 23</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-023/845</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-023/846</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-023/1437</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-023/1676</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-023/1677</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-023/1678</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-023/1679</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-023/1680</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-023</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-023</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">United Kingdom</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">2016-2019</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The science is driven by the data and is being termed as data science. In this internet age, the volume of the data has grown up to petabytes, and this large, complex, structured or unstructured, and heterogeneous data in the form of “Big Data” has gained significant attention. The rapid pace of data growth through various disparate sources, especially social media such as Facebook, has seriously challenged the data analytic capabilities of traditional relational databases. The velocity of the expansion of the amount of data gives rise to a complete paradigm shift in how new age data is processed. Confidence in the data engineering of the existing data processing systems is gradually fading whereas the capabilities of the new techniques for capturing, storing, visualizing, and analyzing data are evolving. In this review paper, we discuss some of the modern Big Data models that are leading contributors in the NoSQL era and claim to address Big Data challenges in reliable and efficient ways. Also, we take the potential of Big Data into consideration and try to reshape the original operationaloriented definition of “Big Science” (Furner, 2003) into a new data-driven definition and rephrase it as “The science that deals with Big Data is Big Science.”</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-11-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-041</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-041</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 138-157</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-041/11</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-041</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The main motivation of this paper is to provide a semi-automatic platform which can construct fairly comprehensive domain ontology from unstructured data. Meanwhile, a brief QA System is proposed to simplify the interaction with the domain experts. A novel algorithm MPVW, which extends from the classical algorithm TF-IDF, is proposed to extract the terminologies from domain documents. MPVW balanced more parameters and factors to evaluate the feature of terminologies. The 3-layers taxonomy and terminology hyponymy height provide sufficient guide and prompt for domain experts to construct ontology from terminologies. According to our approach we have developed ROCP, a rapid ontology construction platform which has been applied in the space debris mitigation domain. The experimental data indicates that ROCP has sufficient accuracy to extract terminologies. Meanwhile, it is effective to relieve the labor of domain experts to construct domain ontology.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-09-25</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-023</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 23</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-023/777</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-023/778</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/468</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/469</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/470</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/471</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/472</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/473</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/474</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/475</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/476</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/477</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/478</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-023/479</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The knowledge about Germany’s federal system, which also entails the autonomy of the federal states regarding the higher education system, is fundamental to understand the different approaches towards RDM in Germany. The state initiatives of Thuringia, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Hesse are described to compare them to the state initiative (Landesinitiative NFDI) of Germany’s most populous state of North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW). The aim of the initiative in NRW is to initiate the collaboration between institutions, to link current RDM activities in NRW and to prepare the local institutions for the participation in a National Research Data Infrastructure (Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur, NFDI).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-10-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-025</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-025</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 25</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-025/781</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-025/782</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-025</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-025</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In recent times the FAIR principles became a prominent role as framework for the sustainability of scientific data. Both approaches had always machine actionability, the capability of computational systems to use services on data without human intervention, in their focus. The more technical approach of digital objects turned out to provide a complementary view on several aspects of the policy framework of FAIR from a technical perspective. After a deeper analysis and integration of these concepts by a group of European data experts the discussion intensified on so called FAIR digital objects. But they need to be accompanied by services as building blocks for automated processes. We will describe the components of this framework and its potentials here, and also which services inside this framework are required.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-04-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-015</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-015</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 15</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-015/956</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-015/957</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-015/2139</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-015/2140</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-015</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-015</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Supported by The Chinese Academy of Science and The Ministry of Science and Technology, our center has made much progress in recent years. The center has not only established the database to restore data which contain heat flow data, geomagnetic data, gravity data, etc. but also put them on the Internet (http://gp.wdc.cn) to provide free data service. The center has expended a great deal of effort to rescue the magnetograms observed 100 years ago by the Sheshan Observatory, the earliest geomagnetic observatory in China. The geophysics data of our center are abundant, and the way to get the data and information from the website is very simple and easily obtainable. In the future, the center will edit more data and construct a strong, convenient database in order to provide the better service to users.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-07-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S404</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S404</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S404-S407</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S404/427</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S404</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Metadata design gives us a good tool to help with lexicography. Though it is indispensable for the external metadata of dictionaries, internal metadata design for entry content is even more important. Among these designs, those metadata for heads of character and headwords are still the basic work. These designs provide basic linguistic material and support finishing the work remaining in dictionary compilation. This paper describes a set of metadata of heads of character and headwords with the reference to the Temporary Chinese Dictionary.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-12</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S853</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S853</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S853-S856</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S853/508</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S853</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This paper outlines Data-PE, a framework for evaluating these policies. It takes the form of a conceptual foundation, comprising twelve criteria for evaluation, operationalized through an evaluation tool. Its objective is to function as a flexible means for a variety of stakeholders to appraise individual policies. Examples of the use of the framework are provided and means for the validation of the tool are discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-01-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-047</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-047</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 192-202</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-047/14</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-047</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It was found that; 1) there was obvious prenoon-postnoon asymmetry of SqH in summer and equinox; 2) in summer, equinox, and winter, the averaged foci of Sq were located at 27° N, 29° N, and 35° N, respectively. However, in a single quiet day, the Sq foci might reach a latitude north of 50° N and south of 19° N; 3). There were some inconsistencies in the behavior of the SqH distributions in two longitudinal chains, such as the reverse of SqH variations in the same latitudinal chain and the increase (decrease) of the daily ranges from east to west. All these demonstrated that there might be latitudinal migration of the Sq focus or changes in current intensity during the longitudinal migration of the Sq focus from east to west.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-07-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-26</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-26</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); IAGA183-IAGA191</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Second, an algorithm for similar data retrieval is introduced. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed algorithm works well for the retrieval of the VLF spectrum with a small amount of CPU load.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2010-02-12</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.SS_IGY-002</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.SS_IGY-002</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009): Special Issue; PIGY55-IGY65</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.SS_IGY-002/281</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.SS_IGY-002</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

One of the activity is the provision of seasonal and medium-range climate forecasts to enable decisions concerning livestock herding. Seasonal weather forecasts are critical but there are challenges of timeliness and usability of the forecasts. The challenges are associated with the multiplicity of information sources, methods for data integration and dissemination channels. Institutions including public and Civil Society Organizations usually invest in collecting weather and other data which should be accessible. Often times this data remains hoarded necessitating other organizations to collect similar data. The inter-institutional relations notwithstanding, the lack of data sharing leads to minimal data available for open access. This paper illustrates that this challenge can be addressed by using combined multiple methods to elicit data on weather and other biophysical conditions for pastoralism in Karamoja. In this paper we additionally analyse the opportunities and challenges of using multiple sources of pastoral-relevant data to couple with weather information in support of herding decisions. Building resilient pastoralism that utilizes pasture and water availability will have to utilize available data. It is evident that more robust approaches for data sharing at global, regional and local levels are needed to understand how pastoralists can respond to climate shocks and changes. The paper illustrates the use of a multifaceted-methods approach including open data to develop climate forecast information for risk-reduction oriented information for decision-making. Integration of this data provides insights on how pastoralists have long adapted to a variable and changing climate, the methods and processes of adaptation to losses and damages from the climate shocks.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-11-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-050</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-050</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 50</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-050/727</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-050/728</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/428</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/429</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/740</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/741</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/742</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/743</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/744</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-050/745</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-050</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-050</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Sub-region of Northeastern Uganda</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Strengthening international data sharing networks will not only demand advancing technical, legal, and logistical infrastructure for publishing data in open, accessible formats; it will also require recognizing, respecting, and learning to work across diverse data cultures. This essay introduces a heuristic for pursuing richer characterizations of the “data cultures” at play in international, interdisciplinary data sharing. The heuristic prompts cultural analysts to query the contexts of data sharing for a particular discipline, institution, geography, or project at seven scales – the meta, macro, meso, micro, techno, data, and nano. The essay articulates examples of the diverse cultural forces acting upon and interacting with researchers in different communities at each scale. The heuristic we introduce in this essay aims to elicit from researchers the beliefs, values, practices, incentives, and restrictions that impact how they think about and approach data sharing – not in an effort to iron out differences between disciplines, but instead to showcase and affirm the diversity of traditions and modes of analysis that have shaped how data gets collected, organized, and interpreted in diverse settings.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-09-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-048</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-048</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 48</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-048/896</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-048/897</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-048/1778</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-048/1863</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-048</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-048</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Geomagnetic variation data measured with a fluxgate magnetometer are not absolute but are relative to a baseline and show drift. To enhance the importance of the geomagnetic data at Syowa Station, therefore, it is necessary to correct the continuous variation data by using absolute baseline values acquired by a magnetic theodolite and proton magnetometer. However, the database of baseline values contains outliers. We detected outliers in the database and then converted the geomagnetic variation data to absolute values by using the reliable baseline values.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-05-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-044</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-044</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS243-WDS246</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-044/164</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-044</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Policies concerning the open access to research data try to implement new norms calling for researchers to make their data more openly available. These policies either appeal to the common good or focus on publication and citation as an incentive to bring about a cultural change in how researchers share their data with their peers. But when we compare the total number of publications in the fields of science, technology and medicine with the number data publications from the same time period, the number of openly available datasets is rather small. This indicates that current policies on data sharing are not effective in changing behaviours and bringing about the wanted cultural change. By looking at research communities that are more open to data sharing we can study the social patterns that influence data sharing and point us to possible points for intervention and change.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-014</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-014</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 14</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-014/652</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-014/653</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-014</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-014</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, conventional ESN predictions require a large volume of training samples. Meanwhile, the time sequence data are complicated and unstable, resulting in insufficient learning of this network and difficult training. As a result, the accuracies of conventional ESN predictions are limited. Aimed at this issue, a time series prediction model of Grey Wolf optimized ESN has been proposed. Wout of ESN was optimized using the Grey Wolf algorithm and predictions of time series data were achieved using simplified training. The results indicated that the optimized time series prediction method exhibits superior prediction accuracy at a small sample size, compared with conventional prediction methods.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-05-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-016</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-016</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 16</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-016/831</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-016/832</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1019</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1020</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1021</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1022</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1023</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1024</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1025</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1026</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-016</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-016</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

There are currently many different methods in use for optimizing digital objects for research purposes. These methods have been applied to many scientific disciplines but differ in architecture and approach. The goals of this joint digital research object (DRO) conference were to discuss the challenge of characterizing DROs at scale in volume and over time and possible organizing principles that might connect current DRO architectures. One of the primary challenges concerns convincing scientists that these tools and practices will actually make the research process easier and more fruitful. This conference included work from CENDI, the National Federal STI Managers Group, the National Federation of Advanced Information Services (NFAIS), the Research Data Alliance (RDA), and the National Academy of Science (NAS).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-06-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-016</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-016</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 16</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-016/763</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-016/764</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-016</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-016</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

GCW fosters international coordination and partnerships with the goal of providing authoritative, clear and usable data, information and analyses on the past, current and future state of the cryosphere. It fosters sustained and mutually beneficial partnerships between research and operational institutions, by linking research and operations as well as scientists and practitioners. This is important as most available cryospheric data come from the scientific community. It is generally managed by research institutes which often do not have the infrastructure, the resources, nor the mandate to enable FAIR data management, which is necessary for interoperability and discovery at data level. This implies that data do not fit into standardized systems or dataflows for broader data access and exchange (as exists at the WMO) and thus have been unavailable for operational meteorological and climate applications. This lack of standardization also impairs the reuse of data within the scientific community. GCW is bridging this gap through a data portal and software stack enabling the transformation of sparsely documented and highly variable data into standardized and well documented data suitable for downstream applications with data level interoperability. A processing engine converts raw data provided by the data producers into NetCDF-CF standard files with NetCDF Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) metadata. The data portal web front end harvests the metadata necessary for its search engine through an OPeNDAP server so no manual editing of the medatadata is necessary. When a user downloads some data from the web portal, it gets the requested data through the OPeNDAP server.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\">European Union’s Horizon 2020</dc:contributor><dc:date>2020-02-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-006</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-006</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 6</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-006/935</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-006/936</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2097</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2098</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2099</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2100</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2101</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2102</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2103</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2107</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2108</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2109</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2251</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2252</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2253</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-006/2254</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-006</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-006</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Natural Resources and Ecology GIS Database sponsored by the Council of Agriculture, which is part of the National Geographic Information System planned by the Ministry of Interior, was the most well established biodiversity database in Taiwan. But thisThis database was, however, mainly collectingcollected the distribution data of terrestrial animals and plants within the Taiwan area. In 2001, GBIF was formed, and Taiwan joined as one of the an Associate Participant and started, starting the establishment and integration of animal and plant species databases; therefore, TaiBIF was able to co-operate with GBIF. The information of Catalog of Life, specimens, and alien species were integrated by the Darwin core. The standard. These metadata standards allowed the biodiversity information of Taiwan to connect with global databases.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S2</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S2-S10</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S2/378</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S2</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

With the speed-up of globalization, wider adoption of computers and advanced communication technologies, and more frequent academic exchanges and co-operation, collaborative research across organizations, regions, and fields has provided greater access to Chinese researchers in the humanities and social sciences. Accordingly, co-authored papers have witnessed considerable growth in number and proportion. The Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities Citation Index (A&amp;amp;HCI), published by the Institute for Scientific Information (USA), enjoy a high reputation worldwide as large-scale and comprehensive retrieval systems for international large comprehensive papers and citations. This article aims to reveal the trends of Chinese collaborative research in the humanities and social sciences from the perspective of bibliometrics and offer advice for Chinese researchers and managers in these fields, by analyzing Chinese co-authored papers in the humanities and social sciences indexed in the SSCI and A&amp;amp;HCI in the last decade (1995-2004).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S571</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S571</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S571-S580</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S571/459</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S571</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, the problems of search speed differences and combining the two separate search results are two major challenges. In this paper, two kinds of search strategies, synchronous search and asynchronous search, are proposed to solve these problems in the heterogeneous structure database and the property database found in ChemDB, a chemistry database owned by the Institute of Process Engineering, CAS. Their advantages and disadvantages under different conditions are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we applied these two searches to ChemDB and used them to screen for potential molecules that can work as CO2 absorbents. The results reveal that this combined search discovers reasonable target molecules within an acceptable time frame.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-003</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-003</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 3</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-003/548</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-003/547</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-003</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-003</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Convertibility (uniqueness) of type definitions is a helpful criterion for database design, whereas convertibility of instances is a criterion for the uniqueness of instances (records). However, in many situations with or without generalization/specialization, convertibility appears to be an insufficient criterion for correctness of instances, which is illustrated by many examples. In order to be able to specify more rigorous rules for correctness of instances we propose to use new concepts such as 'identifying property'. These new concepts also facilitate the transformation of relational databases into Xplain databases.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2012-02-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.010-037</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.010-037</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 11 (2012); 1-36</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.010-037/46</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.010-037</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

To this end a digital object should be associated with metadata appropriate for interpreting that object; such metadata are often referred as representation information. Even such metadata may not be intelligible, however, so we may have to associate them with extra metadata, and so on. This paper approaches this problem by introducing an abstract model comprising modules and dependencies. Community knowledge is formalized over the same model by introducing the notion of profile. This notion is then exploited for deciding representation information adequacy (during input) and intelligibility (during output). Subsequently some general dependency management services for identifying and filling intelligibility gaps during input and output are described and analysed. Finally a prototype system based on these ideas is described.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-05-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-071</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.007-071</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 139-151</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-071/229</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.007-071</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Persistent identifiers were invented to address challenges arising from the distributed and disorganised nature of the internet, which often resulted in URLs to internet endpoints becoming invalid. Over the years several different persistent identifier systems have been applied to the identification of research data, not all with the same level of success in terms of uptake and sustainability. We investigate the uptake of persistent identifier systems and discuss the factors that might determine the stability and longevity of these systems. Persistent identifiers have become essential elements of global research data infrastructures. Understanding the factors that influence the stability and longevity of persistent identifier systems will help us guide the future development of this important element of research data infrastructures and will make it easier to adapt to future technological and organisational changes.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-03-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-009</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 9</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-009/640</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-009/641</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-009</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-009</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper, a method based on pattern matching and machine learning (PMML) was proposed to analyze the emotional tendencies of network public opinion. Firstly, the key words in public opinion were extracted, then the patterns were extracted and matched, and the emotional tendencies of words were calculated to obtain the pattern sequence vectors. Support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to classify emotional tendencies. The Internet reviews of Meituan hotel were taken as the experimental subject. PMML method was found to have a high classification performance, with a maximum accuracy of 86.75%. It suggested the effectiveness of the proposed method. Then PMML method was used to classify the emotional tendencies of the collected reviews, and the results showed that the negative emotional tendency was greater than the positive tendency, which showed the inadequacy of Meituan hotel. The experiments in this paper provide some basis for the application of PMML in sentiment analysis of Internet public opinion.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-01-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-007</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-007</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 7</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-007/813</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-007/814</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-007/1272</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-007</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-007</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The sharing and reuse of research data can play a key role in enhancing the reusability and reproducibility of research, and data from publicly funded projects are assumed to be public goods. This is seen as a movement of open science and, more specifically, open research data. Many countries, such as the USA, UK, and Australia, are pushing ahead with implementing policies and infrastructure for open research data. In this paper, we present survey results pertaining to the creation, management, and utilization of data for researchers from government-funded research institutes of science and technology in Korea. We then introduce recent regulations stipulating a mandated data management plan for national R&amp;amp;D projects and on-going efforts to realize open research data in Korea.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-08-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-029</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-029</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 29</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-029/982</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-029/983</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2221</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2222</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2223</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2224</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2225</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2226</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2227</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2228</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2229</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2230</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2231</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2232</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-029/2233</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-029</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-029</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this respect, its MatDB Online facility is a Standards-based system for preserving, managing, and exchanging engineering materials test data. While MatDB Online has evolved over more than 30 years to incorporate the latest innovations in data preservation and exchange, such as XML-based data transfer and data citation using digital object identifiers, it continues to rely on a robust data model developed more than 30 years ago through the joint efforts of the National Research Institute for Metals (the predecessor to NIMS, the National Institute for Materials Science), the European Commission Joint Research Centre, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. While this data model has endured over many years, there is no corresponding Standard. Similarly, related efforts by the engineering materials community to deliver a Standard representation for engineering materials, such as MatML, have failed to be ratified. In consequence of the continued absence of a Standard representation for engineering materials data, there is no common mechanism for preserving and exchanging materials data and no formal means of maintaining a data model to support advances in materials technology, such as the emergence of nanomaterials. It is for these reasons that the European Commission Institute for Energy and Transport is supporting SERES, a CEN Workshop on Standards for Electronic Reporting in the Engineering Sector. As one of more than thirty organisations supporting the SERES Workshop, the Institute for Energy and Transport will make the MatDB XML schema available as one of several resources that will be taken into consideration when the prenormative Standard for representing engineering materials data is formulated. With the participation of the Institute for Energy and Transport in the SERES Workshop taking place in parallel with a related project with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, there is good reason to expect that a Standard representation for engineering materials, which has so far eluded the materials community, will be realised. This paper describes MatDB support for engineering materials Standards and related innovative features.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2012-11-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.AMDS-003</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.AMDS-003</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 11 (2012): Special Issue; ASMD11-ASMD16</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.AMDS-003/65</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.AMDS-003</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, workers from developing nations that harbor rich biodiversity often do not have access to biodiversity information and often are not keen on making what data they have accessible to others. Open access initiatives offer a great opportunity to make the world's biodiversity information accessible to anyone, at any time and in any place. This article reviews the state of open access in the developing world and argues for the increase of data on biodiversity in the public domain. It makes specific suggestions about how the developing world can reap the benefits of this global S&amp;amp;T movement to better conserve and sustain biotic resources through the creation of a \"virtual biodiversity research space\".</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-06-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.1</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 1-17</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.1/450</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.1</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

First stage data handling in CrDAP focused on integrating point observational and photographic data. The metadata structure of CrDAP was extended based on ISO 19115, which is a geographic information metadata standard of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-04-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-034</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-034</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS197-WDS200</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-034/137</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-034</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Emerging institutional and international environmental initiatives, like the ESA and EC Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), require access to full historical data collections, including the performed data elaborations, scientific analysis, models and results. The historical ESA Earth Observation archives account for Petabytes data holding, which is augmented, since the launch of Envisat in 2002, by some 500 Terabytes per year. The access and utilisation of these archives is an important measurement for long-term data preservation; improving it is a continuous challenge at programmatic, technological and operational level. This article describes how Digital Library and Grid technology can support the underlying infrastructure for long-term data preservation.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.222</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.3.222</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 3 (2004): Special Issue; 222-226</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.222/305</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.3.222</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Poles exist as a frozen dream to most people. The International Polar Year wants to break the ice (so to speak), open up the Poles to the general public, support current polar research, and encourage new research projects. The IPY officially begins in March, 2007. As part of this effort, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), are developing three Landsat mosaics of Antarctica and an Antarctic Web Portal with a Community site and an online map viewer. When scientists are able to view the entire scope of polar research, they will be better able to collaborate and locate the resources they need. When the general public more readily sees what is happening in the polar environments, they will understand how changes to the polar areas affect everyone.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-06-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S333</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S333</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S333-S352</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S333/418</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S333</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This led to the adoption of key agreements such as the Sustainable Development Goals. In this regard, it is important to identify and evaluate under-recognized disaster risks that hinder sustainable development: measures to mitigate climate change are the same as those that build resilience against climate-related disasters. To do this we need to advance scientific and technical knowledge, build data infrastructure that allows us to predict events with greater accuracy, and develop data archives. For this reason we have developed the Data Integration and Analysis System (DIAS). DIAS incorporates analysis, data and models from many fields and disciplines. It collects and stores data from satellites, ground observation stations and numerical weather prediction models; integrates this data with geographical and socio-economic information; then generates results for crisis management of global environmental issues. This article gives an overview of DIAS and summarizes its application to climate change analysis and disaster risk reduction. As the article shows, DIAS aims to initiate cooperation between different stakeholders, and contribute to the creation of scientific knowledge. DIAS provides a model for sharing transdisciplinary research data that is essential for achieving the goal of sustainable development.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-09-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-041</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-041</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 41</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-041/708</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-041/709</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-041/309</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-041/310</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-041/311</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-041/312</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-041/313</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-041/314</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-041/315</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-041</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-041</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Global, Myanmar</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

There are as many arguments about how datasets are like cakes1 as there are about how datasets aren’t like cakes.2It can be easy to categorise a dataset as being a special class of academic paper. Positively, this means that the tools and services for scholarly publication can be utilised to transmit and verify datasets, improving visibility, reproducibility, and attribution for the dataset creators. Negatively, if a dataset doesn’t fit within the criteria to meet the “academic publication” mould (e.g. because it is being continually versioned and updated, or it is still being collected and will be for decades) it might be considered to be of less value to the community.It is often said that “all models are wrong, but some are useful” (Box, 1979). Hence we need to determine the usefulness and limits of models and metaphors, especially when trying to develop new processes and systems. This paper further develops the metaphors outlined in Parsons and Fox (2013), and gives real world examples of the metaphors from scientific data stored in the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) – a discipline-specific environmental data repository, and the processes that created the datasets.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-08-14</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-039</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-039</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 39</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-039/878</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-039/879</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-039</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-039</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

As about 80% of the English words in Korean newspapers appear in abbreviated form, it is necessary to make clusters of translation words to construct easily bilingual knowledge bases such as dictionaries and translation patterns. As a seed to acquiring a translation cluster, we selected a proper translation word from a given translation set using bi-gram-based histograms. Translation words that share bi-grams with the chosen proper translation word are assigned to the cluster for the proper word. The given translation set then picks out the translation words of the cluster. These processes continue until the translation set becomes empty. Experimental results show that our algorithms are superior to bi-gram-based binary vectors including Dice coefficient and Jaccard coefficient in selecting the proper translation word for each translation cluster.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S125</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S125</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S125-S131</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S125/392</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S125</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Although collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation approaches perform well in some applications, they do not produce satisfactory recommendations for academic items because they fail to reflect researchers’ unique characteristics in terms of authority, popularity, recentness, etc. In this paper, we propose two novel data structures, ALVector, which expresses various objective attributes of an article, and AUVector, which expresses users’ subjective weights for different attributes. Then, we propose a novel personalization-oriented recommendation method that utilizes both the content and non-content attributes in ALVector and AUVector for making recommendations. In order to make the overall best recommendation, the VIKOR algorithm is used with a personalization-oriented method to achieve a compromise solution.

The International Service of Geomagnetic Indices (ISGI) is in charge of the derivation and dissemination of the geomagnetic indices that are acknowledged by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA, an IUGG association). Institutes that are not part of ISGI started early in the Internet age to circulate on-line preliminary values of geomagnetic indices. In the absence of quality stamping, this resulted in a very confusing situation. The ISGI label was found to be the simplest and the safest way to insure quality stamping of circulated geomagnetic indices.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-01-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-004</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj.WDS-004</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS27-WDS31</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-004/58</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj.WDS-004</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The first President, Frederick Rossini, had developed a program for systematic evaluation of thermodynamic data and had established a continuing data center with a large staff of scientists for this purpose. Lewis Branscomb, who was on the CODATA Bureau in the early 1970s, wrote several articles such as \"Support for Reviews and Data Evaluation\" (Science 187, 603, 1975) and \"The Misinformation Explosion: Is the Literature Worth Reviewing?\" (Scientific Research 3, 49, 1968). I was invited by the Editor of Science to contribute an article \"Critical Data for Critical Needs,\" published in 1981, which gave many examples of unreliable data appearing in the primary literature. Other active participants in CODATA, such as Yeram Touloukian, spread the doctrine of critical evaluation with an almost religious fervor. The programs of the early CODATA Conferences were dominated by papers from data evaluation centers that produced reliable, critically evaluated data sets in various scientific fields.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.154</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.154</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007): Special Issue; 154-155</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.154/360</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.154</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, because of financial limits or lack of capability to collect data, required published materials and even restricted materials and developing information from research projects often could not be obtained. The rise of digital techniques and Internet opportunities has allowed data resource sharing of philosophy research. However, although there are several ICPs with large-scale comprehensive commercial databases in the field in China, no real non-profit professional database for philosophy researchers exists. Therefore, in 2002, the Philosophy Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences began a project to build \"The Database of Philosophy Research.\" Until Mar. 2006 the number of subsets had reached 30, with more than 30,000 records, retrieval services reached 6,000, and article-reading reached 30,000. Because of the concept of intellectual property, the service of the database is currently limited to the information held in CASS. Nevertheless, this is the first academic database for philosophy research, so its orientation is towards resource-sharing, leading users to data, and serving large number of demands from other provinces and departments.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S968</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S968</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S968-S972</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S968/522</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S968</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper, we present the development of a data-driven fuzzy-rule-based approach for predicting the overall sensory acceptability of food products, in this case composite cassava-wheat bread. The model was formulated using the Takagi-Sugeno and Kang (TSK) fuzzy modeling approach. Experiments with the model derived from sampled data were simulated on Windows 2000XP running on Intel 2Gh environment. The fuzzy membership function for the sensory scores is implemented in MATLAB 6.0 using the fuzzy logic toolkit, and weights of each linguistic attribute were obtained using a Correlation Coefficient formula. The results obtained are compared to those of human judgments. Overall assessments suggest that, if implemented, this approach will facilitate a better acceptability of cassava bread as well as nutritionally improved food.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-04-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-006</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.007-006</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 70-77</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-006/211</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.007-006</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

With this aim, small-scale geographical databases in Turkey were produced in the past and are still in use today. There are, however, problems in using the available geographical databases. These problems in forming, sharing, updating, and meeting requirements necessitate the reconfiguration of the present system. Classical approaches are preferred when updating the present geographical databases. Many errors and difficulties in recording new objects have occurred in the field, in scanning and collecting data from related institutions, and in recording and controlling nonstandard completion data. Thus it is difficult to achieve the desired high quality data with the present method. In this study, we introduce and discuss updating and completing small-scale maps of geographical bases. The Geographical Information System formation studies in Turkey are summarized, and a model is proposed for the formation, updating, and completion of systems of small-scale maps of significant databases.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-05-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S261</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S261</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S261-S269</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S261/409</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S261</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Ground data has many limitations including limited data points and lack of data over ocean areas that are not easily accessible. Two regional geomagnetic field modelling techniques, namely polynomial surface modelling (PolyM) and Spherical Cap Harmonic Analysis (SCHA), were applied to CHAMP satellite data recorded between 2001 and 2005 to investigate the use of satellite data to develop a geomagnetic SV model over southern Africa. The resulting regional models of this investigation were validated against the two widely used global field models IGRF 10 and CHAOS-2 using the available ground survey data obtained during the same period over southern Africa. The results suggest that the regional field models can be derived based entirely on satellite data. However, the regional SV models can be improved using both high quality satellite and ground survey data, since they lack the high quality of a global field model like CHAOS-2.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-07-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-11</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-11</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); IAGA64-IAGA68</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-11/97</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-11</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Since the emergence of molecular approaches, many biologists have focused their research, and related methods and instruments for data production, on the study of genes and genomes. While this trend is now shifting, prominent institutions and companies with stakes in molecular biology continue to set standards for what counts as ‘good science’ worldwide, resulting in the use of specific data production technologies as proxy for assessing data quality. This is problematic considering (1) the variability in research cultures, goals and the very characteristics of biological systems, which can give rise to countless different approaches to knowledge production; and (2) the existence of research environments that produce high-quality, significant datasets despite not availing themselves of the latest technologies. Ethnographic research carried out in such environments evidences a widespread fear among researchers that providing extensive information about their experimental set-up will affect the perceived quality of their data, making their findings vulnerable to criticisms by better-resourced peers. These fears can make scientists resistant to sharing data or describing their provenance. To counter this, debates around Open Data need to include critical reflection on how data quality is evaluated, and the extent to which that evaluation requires a localised assessment of the needs, means and goals of each research environment.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-06-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-032</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-032</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 32</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-032/690</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-032/691</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-032</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-032</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

NIST is a non-regulatory agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce with a mission to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST research results in the production and distribution of standard reference materials, calibration services, and datasets. These are generated from a wide range of complex laboratory instrumentation, expert analyses, and calibration processes. In response to a government open data policy, and in collaboration with the broader research community, NIST has developed a federated Open Access to Research (OAR) scientific data infrastructure aligned with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles. Through the OAR initiatives, NIST’s Material Measurement Laboratory Office of Data and Informatics (ODI) recently released a new scientific data discovery portal and public data repository. These science-oriented applications provide dissemination and public access for data from across the broad spectrum of NIST research disciplines, including chemistry, biology, materials science (such as crystallography, nanomaterials, etc.), physics, disaster resilience, cyberinfrastructure, communications, forensics, and others. NIST’s public data consist of carefully curated Standard Reference Data, legacy high valued data, and new research data publications. The repository is thus evolving both in content and features as the nature of research progresses. Implementation of the OAR infrastructure is key to NIST’s role in sharing high integrity reproducible research for measurement science in a rapidly changing world.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-07-08</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-030</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-030</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 30</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-030/861</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-030/862</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-030/1453</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-030/1454</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-030/1455</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-030/1456</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-030/1457</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-030</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-030</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This becomes one of the most important and widely discussed issues in the data science community. The system analysis methods and data mining techniques are able to sustain the solution of this problem. This paper presents an innovative holistic hardware/software system (HSS) developed for efficient management and intellectual analysis of geomagnetic data, registered by Russian geomagnetic observatories and international satellites. Geomagnetic observatories that comprise the International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network (INTERMAGNET) produce preliminary (raw) and definitive (corrected) geomagnetic data of the highest quality. The designed system automates and accelerates routine production of definitive data from the preliminary magnetograms, obtained by Russian observatories, due to implemented algorithms that involve artificial intelligence elements. The HSS is the first system that provides sophisticated automatic detection and multi-criteria classification of extreme geomagnetic conditions, which may be hazardous for technological infrastructure and economic activity in Russia. It enables the online access to digital geomagnetic data, its processing results and modelling calculations along with their visualization on conventional and spherical screens. The concept of the presented system agrees with the accepted ‘four Vs’ paradigm of Big Data. The HSS can increase significantly the ‘velocity’ and ‘veracity’ features of the INTERMAGNET system. It also provides fusion of large sets of ground-based and satellite geomagnetic data, thus facilitating the ‘volume’ and ‘variety’ of handled data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-12-16</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-018</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2016-018</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 18</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-018/618</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-018/619</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/266</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/267</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/268</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/269</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/270</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/271</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/272</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/273</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/274</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/275</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/276</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/277</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/278</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/279</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/280</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/281</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/282</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/283</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-018/284</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-018</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-018</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Territory of the Russian Federation</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Experimental results performing on real-world social benchmark networks and artificially simulated networks give a satisfactory correspondence.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-11-26</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-030</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-030</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 30</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-030/795</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-030/796</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-030/1172</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-030/1254</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-030/1267</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-030</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-030</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Deterioration, format obsolescence, and insufficient metadata for discovery are significant problems leading to loss of scientific data. The research presented in this paper considers these potentially lost data. Four one-hour focus groups and a demographic survey were conducted with 14 scientists to learn about their attitudes toward endangered data, data sharing, data reuse, and their opinions of the DARI inventory. The results indicate that unavailability, lack of context, accessibility issues, and potential endangerment are key concerns to scientists.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-01-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12-048</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.12-048</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013); 207-219</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12-048/51</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.12-048</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

As an example, three base entities may contain records describing a person, a publication and a project while two link entities relate respectively the person to the publication in role author and the person to the project in role project leader. This powerful linking or inter-relating capability includes temporal as well as role aspects and inter-relates dynamically and flexibly all the components of R&amp;amp;D. The CERIF model can be extended to inter-relate appropriate information from legacy information systems in an organisation, such as those covering accounting, human resources, project management, assets, stock control, etc. A CERIF-CRIS can thus provide a flexible low-cost integration comparable with an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) System, particularly in an organisation with R&amp;amp;D as its primary business.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2010-04-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.CRIS2</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.CRIS2</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010): Special Issue; CRIS7-CRIS13</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.CRIS2/151</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.CRIS2</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Test data, which are kept in XML format and sent by R&amp;amp;D project partners via the World Wide Web to the Petten Server are stored within the Mat-DB XML module. There they can be checked and updated on-line before they are uploaded into the database.

As for distributed spatial datasets, the current centralized administrative scheme may become the system performance bottleneck. This paper presents a distributed cooperative grid computing technology to facilitate complex spatial applications by collaboration among distributed spatial resources. A hierarchical spatial index and communication protocol has been designed for the collaboration, which enables a dynamical choice for the best quality nodes for specified subtasks, synchronized execution, and compensation for a failure to execute a subtask. Also, we present an approach for dynamic resource allocation and distributed transaction mechanics to ensure consistency.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-12</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S889</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S889</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S889-S897</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S889/513</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S889</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Australian Antarctic Data Centre is such a facility. How this centre is approaching the administration of Antarctic science data is described in the following paper and serves to demonstrate key facets necessary for undertaking polar data management in an increasingly connected global data environment.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-09-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-02</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj.IFPDA-02</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014): Special Issue; PDA8-PDA14</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IFPDA-02/19</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj.IFPDA-02</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

On the other hand, a more pragmatic approach is to start from what currently exists, identify best practices and key issues, and promote effective inter-domain collaboration among different components forming an ecosystem. This will promote interoperability, data exchange, data preservation, and distributed access (among others). This ecosystem of interoperable research data infrastructures will be composed of regional, disciplinary, and multidisciplinary components, such as libraries, archives, and data centres, offering data services for both primary datasets and publications. The ecosystem will support data-intensive science and research and stimulate the interaction among all its elements, thus promoting multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary science. This special issue includes a set of independent papers from renowned experts on organisational and technological issues related to GRDIs. These documents feed into and compliment the GRDI2020 roadmap, which supports a Global Research Data Infrastructure ecosystem.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-07-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-001</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-001</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; GRDI1-GRDI5</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-001/202</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-001</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

With the increasing demand for libraries, the traditional library management method has been difficult to support the demand. In order to promote the intelligent transformation of the library, the basic structure and principle of Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) technology were briefly introduced in this paper, and the intelligent library management system based on RFID was also introduced. Then the library of Huaqiao University was divided into two regions, and the performance of collection counting, book query and passage efficiency of traditional library management based on magnetic stripe together with bar code and intelligent library management based on RFID were compared. The results showed that the collection counting efficiency of intelligent libraries was much higher than that of traditional libraries, the high accuracy and stability of book query avoided the dislocation and chaos like traditional libraries, and there was no congestion even during rush hours because of the higher passing efficiency.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-11-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-053</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-053</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 53</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-053/906</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-053/907</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-053/1644</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-053/1645</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-053/1646</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-053/1647</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-053/1648</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-053/1649</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-053</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-053</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Hence it is legitimate to speak of the so-called information society; but a scientific understanding of the Information Age has not had time to develop. Following this evolution we face the need of a new transdisciplinary understanding of information, encompassing many academic disciplines and new fields of interest. Therefore a Science of Information is required. The goal of this paper is to discuss the aims, the scope, and the tools of a Science of Information. Furthermore we describe the new Science of Information Institute (SOII), which will be established as an international and transdisciplinary organization that takes into consideration a larger perspective of information.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-04-26</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S198</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S198</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S198-S205</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S198/401</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S198</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

They compare the results of a request launched on Western and Chinese databases concerning Chinese scientific paper publication. Although Chinese scientists are having more and more visibility in international scientific journals, their publications in English are far fewer than those in Chinese. The difference is so drastic that it emphasizes the need for westerners (researchers and observers) to access and master the use of Chinese sources of information. The aim of this paper is to define the specificity of Chinese scientific information and also to present some primary results concerning the automatic analysis of Chinese writing. Our method uses a specific core language close to the point of view of the expert and his or her knowledge that will permit accurate information retrieval from a huge quantity of documents.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2010-01-13</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-034</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.007-034</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 259-272</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-034/253</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.007-034</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Among persistent identifiers, Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) stand out quite prominently, with approximately 133 million DOIs assigned to various objects as of February 2017. While the assignment of DOIs to objects such as scientific publications has been in place for many years, their assignment to Earth science data sets is more recent. Applying persistent identifiers to data sets enables improved tracking of their use and reuse, facilitates the crediting of data producers, and aids reproducibility through associating research with the exact data set(s) used. Maintaining provenance – i.e., tracing back lineage of significant scientific conclusions to the entities (data sets, algorithms, instruments, satellites, etc.) that lead to the conclusions, would be prohibitive without persistent identifiers. This paper provides a brief background on the use of persistent identifiers in general within the US, and DOIs more specifically. We examine their recent use for Earth science data sets, and outline successes and some remaining challenges. Among the challenges, for example, is the ability to conveniently and consistently obtain data citation statistics using the DOIs assigned by organizations that manage data sets.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-21</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-023</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-023</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 23</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-023/671</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-023/673</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-023/255</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-023</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-023</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">n/a</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">n/a</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">n/a</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper, we present an effort to solicit feedback on cyberinfrastructure needs from a broad community of geoscientists by means of user scenarios to inform the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) EarthCube program. The method for the user scenarios was semi-structured interviews, a total of 50 of which were collected from a broad range of scientists and analyzed. A wide variety of challenges were identified, with the most commonly articulated challenges being an inability to find data of interest in an online repository, the heterogeneity of data and metadata, the lack of needed software (which in turn drove redundant development of needed software in multiple groups), and insufficient or unstable funding for long-term cyberinfrastructure. While the user scenarios do not provide formal requirements in the software engineering sense, they do provide expressions of user challenges that, in many cases, are sufficiently detailed to inform high-level requirement development.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\">NSF</dc:contributor><dc:date>2019-06-18</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-021</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-021</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 21</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-021/841</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-021/842</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-021/1395</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-021/1681</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-021</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-021</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Low back pain is prevalent in society yet few validated 3D models of the lumbar spine exist to facilitate assessment. We therefore created a 3D surface data set for lumbar vertebrae from human vertebrae. Models from 86 lumbar vertebrae were constructed using an inexpensive method involving image capture by digital camera and reconstruction of 3D models via an image-based technique. The reconstruction method was validated using a laser-based arm scanner and measurements derived from real vertebrae using electronic callipers. Results show a mean relative error of 5.2% between image-based models and real vertebrae, a mean relative error of 4.7% between image-based and arm scanning models and 95% of vertices’ errors are less than 3.5 millimetres with a median of 1.1 millimetres. The accuracy of the method indicates that the generated models could be useful for biomechanical modelling or 3D visualisation of the spine.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-08-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2016-009</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 9</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/Array</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-009/600</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-009/601</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/5</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/6</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/7</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/8</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/9</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/10</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/11</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/12</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/13</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/14</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/15</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/16</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/17</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-009/18</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-009</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-009</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess</dc:rights><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Typically subject to substantial processing, observational data are used by research communities, their research groups and individual scientists, who interpret such primary data for their meaning in the context of research investigations. The result of interpretation is information—meaningful secondary or derived data—about the observed environment. Research infrastructures and research communities are thus essential to evolving uninterpreted observational data to information. In digital form, the classical bearer of information are the commonly known “(elaborated) data products,” for instance maps. In such form, meaning is generally implicit e.g., in map colour coding, and thus largely inaccessible to machines. The systematic acquisition, curation, possible publishing and further processing of information gained in observational data interpretation—as machine readable data and their machine readable meaning—is not common practice among environmental research infrastructures. For a use case in aerosol science, we elucidate these problems and present a Jupyter based prototype infrastructure that exploits a machine learning approach to interpretation and could support a research community in interpreting observational data and, more importantly, in curating and further using resulting information about a studied natural phenomenon.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-09-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-021</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-021</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 21</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-021/773</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-021/774</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-021/1058</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-021/1059</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-021/1060</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-021/1061</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-021</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-021</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In the article, methods of formation and primary analysis of the data, their processing in real time and obtaining time series of various parameters of integral counting rate and angular anisotropy of the muon flux, which are important for the physical analysis of modulation processes of cosmic rays in the heliosphere, are presented.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-03-16</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-011</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-011</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 11</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-011/948</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-011/949</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-011/834</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-011/835</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-011/836</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-011/837</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-011/2174</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-011/2175</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-011</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-011</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

When a leader cannot make this decision, action will be determined through community member discussion.

In order to monitor conditions and diagnose defects in a rolling element bearing, a new approach is developed, based on the characteristic defect octave frequencies. The characteristic defect frequencies make it possible to detect the presence of a defect and diagnose in what part of the bearing the defect appears. However, because the characteristic defect frequencies vary with rotational speed, it is difficult to extract feature information from data at variable rotational speeds. In this paper, the characteristic defect octave frequencies, which do not vary with rotation speed, are introduced to replace the characteristic defect frequencies. Therefore feature information can be easily extracted. Moreover, based on characteristic defect octave frequencies, an envelope spectrum array, which associates 3-D visualization technology with extremum envelope spectrum technology, is established. This method has great advantages in acquiring the characteristics and trends of the data and achieves a straightforward and creditable result.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S596</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S596</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S596-S602</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S596/464</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S596</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Datanature (all data in cyberspace) is forming due to a data explosion. Exploring the patterns and rules in datanature is necessary but difficult. A new discipline called Data Science is coming. It provides a type of novel research method (a data-intensive method) for natural and social sciences and goes beyond computer science in researching data. This paper presents the challenges presented by data and discusses what differentiates data science from the established sciences, data technologies, and big data. Our goal is to encourage data related researchers to transfer their focus towards this new science.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-008</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-008</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 8</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-008/568</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-008/569</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-008</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-008</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Constructing an efficient classifier with a small set of high quality rules is a highly important but indeed a challenging task. The lazy learning associative classification method successfully removes the need for a classifier but suffers from high computation costs. This paper proposes a Compact Highest Subset Confidence-Based Associative Classification scheme that generates compact subsets based on information gain and classifies the new samples without constructing classifiers. Experimental results show that the proposed system out performs both the traditional and the existing lazy learning associative classification methods.−−−−−Paper presented at 1st International Symposium on Big Data and Cloud Computing Challenges (ISBCC-2014) March 27-28, 2014.

The U.S. Federal statistical system has established practices and procedures that enable others to access the confidential data it collects. The two main methods are to restrict the content of the data (termed \"restricted data\") prior to release to the general public and to restrict the conditions under which the data can be accessed, i.e., at what locations, for what purposes (termed \"restricted access\"). This paper reviews restricted data and restricted access practices in several U.S. statistical agencies. It concludes with suggestions for sharing confidential social science data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2003-02-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.66</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.2.66</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 2 (2003); 66-74</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.66/195</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.2.66</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, the problems of search speed differences and combining the two separate search results are two major challenges. In this paper, two kinds of search strategies, synchronous search and asynchronous search, are proposed to solve these problems in the heterogeneous structure database and the property database found in ChemDB, a chemistry database owned by the Institute of Process Engineering, CAS. Their advantages and disadvantages under different conditions are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we applied these two searches to ChemDB and used them to screen for potential molecules that can work as CO2 absorbents. The results reveal that this combined search discovers reasonable target molecules within an acceptable time frame.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-003</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-003</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 3</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-003/548</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-003/547</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-003</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-003</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The CCIN/PDC has since expanded its collection to include data from health, ecological, social, and other sciences. Since its inception, CCIN/PDC has engaged Indigenous and northern Canadians to understand and meet their information needs. This paper describes three instances of such engagement and next steps for enhanced interaction and support.First, feedback from northern and Indigenous communities led to the development of PDC Lite. Compared to the full-featured online PDC Search application, PDC Lite accommodates slower Internet speeds and allows one to search by particular northern communities. PDC Lite continues to be improved by input from the people that it serves.Next, to facilitate discussion and strengthen collaborative relationships within the polar data community, CCIN/PDC co-hosted two major meetings in 2015. Emerging from both these events was a need to prioritize what has been termed human interoperability and the need to have Indigenous and northern community involvement at all levels of data management.Future plans for CCIN/PDC include more effective partnerships in which we work with and listen to northern and Indigenous Canadians to better understand their requirements for data management services and expertise. Our ultimate goal is to provide, through collaboration with partners, data, information, and expertise that facilitate northern and Indigenous Canadians’ access to publicly-archived data and enable and support management of their own data and resources.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-10-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-048</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-048</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 48</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-048/723</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-048/724</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-048</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-048</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">N/A</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">N/A</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">N/A</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is a data-adaptive method that is best suitable for data with nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics. The average monthly rainfall and temperature data for a selected region in South Africa are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) at different time scales using EEMD. The IMFs exhibit an inter-annual to inter-decadal variability. The influence of climatic oscillations such as El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is identified. The influence of temperature variability on rainfall is also shown at different time scales. Based on the results obtained, the EEMD method is found to be suitable to identify different oscillations in the rainfall and temperature data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-09-25</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-046</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-046</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 46</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-046/892</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-046/893</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1367</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1368</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1369</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1370</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1371</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1372</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1373</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1374</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1375</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1376</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1377</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1378</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1379</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1380</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1381</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1382</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1383</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1384</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1385</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1386</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1387</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1388</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-046/1389</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-046</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-046</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Global Roads Open Access Data Set (gROADS), version 1, is a first step in that direction. gROADS relies on data from a wide range of sources and was developed using a range of methods. Traditionally, map development was highly centralized and controlled by government agencies due to the high cost or required expertise and technology. In the past decade, however, high resolution satellite imagery and global positioning system (GPS) technologies have come into wide use, and there has been significant innovation in web services, such that a number of new methods to develop geospatial information have emerged, including automated and semi-automated road extraction from satellite/aerial imagery and crowdsourcing. In this paper we review the data sources, methods, and pros and cons of a range of road data development methods: heads-up digitizing, automated/semi-automated extraction from remote sensing imagery, GPS technology, crowdsourcing, and compiling existing data sets. We also consider the implications for each method in the production of open data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-05-15</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-001</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-001</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 45-66</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-001/4</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-001</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, when it comes to publishing their work, there are no common, well-established standards on how to make that data available to other researchers. Consequently, data are often not stored in a consistent manner, making it hard or impossible to find data sets associated with an article - even though such data might be essential to reproduce results or to perform further analysis. Data repositories can play an important role in improving this situation, offering increased visibility, domain-specific coordination, and expert knowledge on data management. As a leading STM publisher, Elsevier is actively pursuing opportunities to establish links between the online scholarly article and data repositories. This helps to increase usage and visibility for both articles and data sets and also adds valuable context to the data. These data-linking efforts tie in with other initiatives at Elsevier to enhance the online article in order to connect with current researchers’ workflows and to provide an optimal platform for the communication of science in the digital era.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-05-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-043</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-043</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS235-WDS242</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-043/162</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-043</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The high quality magnetic field measurements from CHAMP made it possible to extract and clearly resolve Pi2 and Pc3 pulsations in LEO satellite data. Our analyses for nighttime Pi2 pulsations are indicative of a cavity mode resonance. However, observations of daytime Pi2 pulsation events identified in ground station data show no convincing evidence of their occurrence in CHAMP data. We also studied low-latitude Pc3 pulsations and found that different types of field line resonant structure occur, namely discrete frequencies driven by a narrow band source and L-dependent frequencies driven by a broad band source.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-06-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-03</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-03</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); IAGA10-IAGA18</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-03/82</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-03</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Metadata design gives us a good tool to help with lexicography. Though it is indispensable for the external metadata of dictionaries, internal metadata design for entry content is even more important. Among these designs, those metadata for heads of character and headwords are still the basic work. These designs provide basic linguistic material and support finishing the work remaining in dictionary compilation. This paper describes a set of metadata of heads of character and headwords with the reference to the Temporary Chinese Dictionary.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-12</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S853</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S853</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S853-S856</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S853/508</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S853</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Organizing and reflecting relationships across data collections, datasets, publications, and other research objects are essential functionalities of the modern science environment, yet challenging to implement. Landing pages are often used for providing ‘big picture’ contextual frameworks for datasets and data collections, and many large-volume data holders are utilizing them in thoughtful, creative ways. The benefits of their organizational efforts, however, are not realized unless the user eventually sees the landing page at the end point of their search. What if that organization and ‘big picture’ context could benefit the user at the beginning of the search? That is a challenging approach, but The Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) is redesigning the database functionality of the DOE Data Explorer (DDE) with that goal in mind. Phase I is focused on redesigning the DDE database to leverage relationships between two existing distinct populations in DDE, data Projects and individual Datasets, and then adding a third intermediate population, data Collections. Mapped, structured linkages, designed to show user relationships, will allow users to make informed search choices. These linkages will be sustainable and scalable, created automatically with the use of new metadata fields and existing authorities. Phase II will study selected DOE Data ID Service clients, analyzing how their landing pages are organized, and how that organization might be used to improve DDE search capabilities. At the heart of both phases is the realization that adding more metadata information for cross-referencing may require additional effort for data scientists. OSTI’s approach seeks to leverage existing metadata and landing page intelligence without imposing an additional burden on the data creators.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-017</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-017</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 17</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-017/658</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-017/659</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-017</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-017</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Addressing this challenge requires a thorough understanding of the underlying issues and effective planning for interventions. Over the years machine learning has gained much attention on addressing the problem of students dropout. This is because machine learning techniques can effectively facilitate determination of at-risk students and timely planning for interventions. In order to collect, organize, and synthesize existing knowledge in the field of machine learning on addressing student dropout; literature in academic journals, books and case studies have been surveyed. The survey reveal that, several machine learning algorithms have been proposed in literature. However, most of those algorithms have been developed and tested in developed countries. Hence, developing countries are facing lack of research on the use of machine learning on addressing this problem. Furthermore, many studies focus on addressing student dropout using student level datasets. However, developing countries need to include school level datasets due to the issue of limited resources. Therefore, this paper presents an overview of machine learning in education with the focus on techniques for student dropout prediction. Furthermore, the paper highlights open challenges for future research directions.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-04-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-014</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-014</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 14</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-014/827</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-014/828</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-014/1555</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-014</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-014</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

From these observations the IPSL has generated a large number of datasets gathering Arctic observations. These observations include measurements on atmospheric chemical composition, snow micro-physical properties or ocean measurements. However, some of these datasets remain locally stored and there is a lack of public awareness regarding these resources, which has hindered their visualisation and sharing. This motivated the creation of the LABEX L-IPSL Arctic metadata Portal (http://climserv.ipsl.polytechnique.fr/arcticportal/), presented here, which improves the visibility of the variety of observations collected within the institute as well as the evaluation of numerical models. The LABEX L-IPSL Arctic metadata Portal will also promote new avenues in Arctic research within the IPSL and with other collaborating institutions.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-01-12</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-002</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 2</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/Array</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-002/583</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-002/584</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-002/1</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-002/2</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-002/3</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-002/4</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-002/20</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-002/21</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Arctic Region</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess</dc:rights><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Fourteen Belmont Forum affiliated individuals were interviewed following a predetermined set of questions to create data curation profiles of their funded work. The data curation profile questionnaire includes questions related to data management, storage, stakeholders, costs, training, and credentials. The interview findings highlight gaps in existing knowledge of data management theory and practice that could impact data re-use. Results of these interviews were used to populate a Toolkit of data management training and effective practice resources specifically developed to train Belmont Forum grant awardees. The results also highlight some attitudes and behaviours of current scientists, researchers, and agency representatives, and the impact of the implementation of data management plans on the open science movement.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-01-27</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-004</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-004</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 4</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-004/931</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-004/932</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-004</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-004</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">global</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The largest transactional databases and data warehouses can no longer be hosted cost-effectively in off-the-shelf commercial database management systems. There are other forums for discussing databases and data warehouses, but they typically deal with problems occurring at smaller scales and do not always focus on practical solutions or influencing DBMS vendors. Given the relatively small (but highly influential and growing) number of users with these databases and the relatively small number of opportunities to exchange practical information related to DBMSes at extremely large scale, a workshop on extremely large databases was organized. This paper is the final report of the discussions and activities at the workshop.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2008-02-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.7.1</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 7 (2008); 1-13</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.1/293</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.7.1</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Discovering frequent itemsets is the key process in association rule mining. Traditional association rule algorithms adopt an iterative method to discovery, which requires very large calculations and a complicated transaction process. Because of this, a new association rule algorithm called ABBM is proposed in this paper. This new algorithm adopts a Boolean vector \"relational calculus\" method to discovering frequent itemsets. Experimental results show that this algorithm can quickly discover frequent itemsets and effectively mine potential association rules.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-09-20</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S559</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S559</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S559-S565</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S559/457</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S559</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper, we aim to solve the current problem that a continuous attribute in a clustering or classification algorithm must be made discrete. We propose a new algorithm of data reduction based on a correlation model with data discretization. It deals with selection of continuous attributes from a very large set of attributes. The proposed algorithm is an extended version of the Fast Correlation-based filter algorithm and is named FCBF+. The FCBF+ algorithm performs the discretization of continuous attributes in an efficient manner. Then it selects the relevant attributes from a very large set of attributes. Performance evaluation is done on clustering accuracy for all the features, and a reduced set of features is obtained using FCBF+. It is found that the proposed FCBF+ algorithm improves the clustering accuracy of various clustering algorithms.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-04-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-044</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.007-044</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 125-138</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-044/227</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.007-044</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Strain data are good examples of such disturbed signals. To determine the geodetic strain behavior before and after the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake (M8.0), we decomposed the disturbed strain data into trend, air pressure, earth tide, and precipitation responses components. The decomposition of the disturbed strain data and the interpolation of the missing observations are performed very effectively by using state-space modeling and the Kalman filter/smoother. The validity of the data processing is confirmed by the fact that the model derived to fit the strain data matches the GPS data extremely well.  1The following contribution was presented at the WDS conference and presents a more complete explanation of the data processing and its implementation. Subsequent to the Conference, the authors completed their research and have published a comprehensive paper presenting their final results in [Modeling of the post-seismic slip of the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake M8 off Hokkaido: constraints from volumetric strain, Earth, Planets and Space, doi: 10.5047/eps.2012.12.003, in press]. That paper includes not only a preliminary data processing presented here, but also contains many additional results concerned with a geophysical phenomenon. The CODATA Data Science Journal regrets the delay in publishing this conference paper.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-04-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-038</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-038</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS216-WDS220</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-038/144</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-038</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Most SDIs will soon converge around a service-oriented-architecture (SOA) using IT standards promulgated primarily by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and ISO Technical Committee 211. There are very few examples of these types of architected SDIs in action, and as a result little detailed information exists on suitable governance models. This paper discusses the governance issues that are posed by SOA-based SDIs, particularly those issues surrounding standards and services management, with reference to an Australian marine case study and the general literature. A generalised governance framework is then postulated using an idealised use case model which is applicable for \"bottom-up,\" community-based initiatives. This model incorporates guiding principles and motivational and self-regulation instruments that are characteristically found in successful open source development activities. It is argued that harnessing an open development model, using a voluntary workforce, could rapidly increase the size of the SDI installed base and importantly defray infrastructure build costs.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-07-25</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.64</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.64</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); 64-90</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.64/344</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.64</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We discuss why this work is important and timely, and review the development of guidelines for the use of DOIs at EOL by focusing on how decisions were made. We discuss progress in assigning DOIs to physical objects and datasets, summarize plans to cite software, describe a current collaboration to develop community tools to display citations on websites, and touch on future plans to cite workflows that document dataset processing and quality control. Finally, we will review the status of efforts to engage our scientific community in the process of using DOIs in their research publications.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-03-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-007</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-007</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 7</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-007/636</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-007/637</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-007</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-007</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">1967-2016</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Thus, within the Collaborative Research Centre/Transregio 32 ‘Patterns in Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Systems’, funded by the German Research Foundation, research data management (RDM) services have been available since early 2007. These services were established to support all researchers during their entire individual research studies. They cover provision of general guidance, support and training for RDM. To fulfil the scientists’ needs and requests with regard to storage, backup, documentation, search and sharing of data with other project members, a project-specific RDM system was designed and implemented. This system was developed and continuously modified in collaboration with the scientists to facilitate their system acceptance. Besides the mentioned services, the system supports further common services such as controlled access to data, rights management, data publication with DOI and data statistics (on repository and single data level). All RDM services provided for the scientists are thus bundled and available to the users in one system: a ‘one-stop-shop’. After more than ten years of RDM service provision for the CRC/TR32, the repository statistics clearly visualize the use of the diverse RDM system services. Furthermore, it has been shown that an RDM adapted to the needs of interdisciplinary researchers can be fruitful and indispensable when scientists conduct their research study e.g. with a time lag. RDM services established at an early stage can contribute to a successful long-term research project.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-01-15</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-005</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-005</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 5</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-005/809</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-005/810</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-005/391</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-005/392</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-005/393</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-005/1225</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-005/1226</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-005/1227</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-005/1228</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-005/1229</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-005</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-005</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this research field, among others, there is a need for an integrated use of social science survey data and spatial science data, e.g. for combining demographic information from survey data with data on pollution from spatial data. However, for researchers it is challenging to link both data sources, because (1) the interdisciplinary nature of both data sources is different, (2) both underlie different legal restrictions, in particular regarding data privacy, and (3) methodological challenges arise regarding the use of geo-information systems (GIS) for the processing and analysis of spatial data.In this article, we present an infrastructure of distributed web services which supports researchers in the process of spatial linking. The infrastructure addresses the challenges researchers have to face during that process. We present an example case study on the investigation of environmental inequalities with regards to income and land use hazards in Germany by using georeferenced survey data of the GESIS Panel and the German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP), and by using spatial data from the Monitor of Settlement and Open Space Development (IOER Monitor). The results show that increasing income of survey respondents is associated with less exposure to land-use-related environmental hazards in Germany.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-07-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-027</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-027</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 27</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-027/978</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-027/979</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/1850</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/1851</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/1852</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/1853</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/1854</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-027/2360</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-027</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-027</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The potential contributions of such data to the creation of new knowledge and downstream economic and social goods can in many cases be multiplied exponentially when the data are made openly available on digital networks. Most developed countries spend large amounts of public resources on research and related scientific facilities and instruments that generate massive amounts of data. Yet precious little of that investment is devoted to promoting the value of the resulting data by preserving and making them broadly available. The largely ad hoc approach to managing such data, however, is now beginning to be understood as inadequate to meet the exigencies of the national and international research enterprise. The time has thus come for the research community to establish explicit responsibilities for these digital resources.

Sixty children of three age groups (8-, 9- and 11-year-old groups) participated in the experiment. Each group included 10 girls and 10 boys. Stimuli were presented in two separate lists: semantic priming list and mental arithmetic list. Participants were instructed to decide whether the target word was a real Chinese character or not in semantic priming task and decide whether the production of the arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication) was correct or false in mental arithmetic task. The main new observation was that the cognitive process reflected by major ERP components changes with the age growing up. In the lexical decision task, the amplitude of N400 elicited by semantic non-related target was significantly larger than that of a related target in all the children groups. The latency and amplitude of N400 component in 8-year-old group were larger than that of 11-year-old group. A similar RP component was elicited by either a Chinese single-character word or pseudo-word as reported by other authors. In mental arithmetic task, similar results were observed that the latencies of P2, N2, P3 in 8-year-group were longer than those of the 11-year-old group. These was no significant differences in amplitude across the three operation and age groups. These results suggest that semantic priming effects and mental arithmetic are developmental processes even in the early childhood. These two cognitive processes may be used to evaluate the development of language and arithmetic abilities.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-09-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S535</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S535</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S535-S547</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S535/448</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S535</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

An ontology grounded in description logics was developed based on the ISO 15926 data model to describe three types of sustainability science conceptualizations: situational knowledge, analytic methods, and scenario frameworks. Semantic statements were then created using this ontology to describe expert knowledge expressed in research proposals and papers related to sustainability science and in scenarios for achieving sustainable societies. Semantic matching based on logic and rule-based inference was used to quantify the conceptual overlap of semantic statements, which shows the semantic similarity of topics studied by different researchers in sustainability science, similarities that might be unknown to the researchers themselves.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-01-13</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.Kraines</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.Kraines</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010); 107-123</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.Kraines/135</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.Kraines</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, the risk for low and low dose-rate radiation is obscure because of a lack of evidence. This risk is currently estimated by extrapolating the radiation response at high doses into low dose ranges for practical purposes. Recent challenges to examine directly the biological responses to low dose radiation using newly developed technologies are unveiling interesting alterations at the molecular level. The interpretation of these data, however, needs careful consideration because they may not be related to any change in biological functions.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-06-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.BR-01</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.BR-01</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009): Special Issue; PBR1-BR4</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.BR-01/251</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.BR-01</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper various techniques are studied and tried, such as XSL transformations (XSLT) and ways of extending the contents of XML Schemas, the final aim being in creating an understanding of the possibilities, and a roadmap that could possibly lead to some useful real-world applications. Based on a materials database an XML Schema is specified that defines the structure of an XML document capable of representing quite complex materials test data together with mandatory metadata. Some approaches are discussed and some of them implemented in prototypes to study the possibilities to comply with and use MatML in order to support sharing of experimentally measured materials data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-03-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.179</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.7.179</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 7 (2008); 179-195</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.179/335</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.7.179</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The goal of the project was to provide the construction professionals with an on-line aid for component specification and selection at different levels of the construction life cycle. This two years project started in 1997 and involved several partners. This paper describes the main features of the information system: databases, query and communication systems. SYDOX(SYstème de DOnnées compleXes) is aimed at defining and demonstrating a prototype to access information about MATerials and COMPonents used in construction, implemented on a WWW server. Though the objective is general, the work was focused on a restricted sub-section of the construction domain. We describe the domain and the scope of the project, the starting point and the lessons learnt from the development of the prototype. We also propose some important ideas on which this research is based.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.1.257</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.1.257</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 1, No 2 (2002); 257-270</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.1.257/185</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.1.257</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Scholars increasingly use scientific and cultural assets in digital form, but choosing which among many objects to cite for the long term can be difficult. There are few well-defined terms to describe the various kinds and qualities of persistence that object repositories and identifier resolvers do or don’t provide. Given an object’s identifier, one should be able to query a provider to retrieve human- and machine-readable information to help judge the level of service to expect and help gauge whether the identifier is durable enough, as a sort of long-term bet, to include in a citation. The vocabulary should enable providers to articulate persistence policies and set user expectations.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-08-14</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-039</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-039</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 39</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-039/705</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-039/706</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-039</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-039</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The workshop brought together more than 65 researchers, data and information managers, archivists, and librarians from 13 countries to discuss the issues involved in making critical decisions regarding the long-term preservation of the scientific record. One of the major aims for this workshop was to provide an international forum to exchange information about data archiving policies and practices across different scientific, institutional, and national contexts. Highlights from the workshop discussions are presented.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.227dsj.3.227</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.3.227dsj.3.227</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 3 (2004): Special Issue; 227-232</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.227dsj.3.227/308</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.3.227dsj.3.227</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Because of recent rapid progress in medical science as well as clinical diagnosis and treatment, integrated and cooperative research among medical researchers, biology, engineering, cultural science, and sociology is required. Therefore, we propose a framework called Cyber Integrated Medical Infrastructure (CIMI). Within this framework, we can deal with various types of data and consequently need to integrate those data prior to analysis. In this study, for medical science, we analyze the features and relationships among various types of data and show the possibility of integrated data mining.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S104</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S104</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S104-S115</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S104/390</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S104</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This method, originally dedicated to scientific fields, measures the association strength between terms in documents to reveal and visualise the evolution of scientific fields through the construction of clusters and strategic diagram. This method has since been successfully applied to investigate the structure of many scientific areas. Nowadays it occurs in many software systems which are used by companies to improve their business, and define their strategy but its relevance to this kind of application has not been proved yet. Using the example of economic and marketing information on DSL technologies from Reuters Business Briefing, this presentation gives an interpretation of co-word analysis for this kind of information. After an overview of the software we used (Sampler) and after an outline of the experimental protocol, we investigate and explain each step of the co-word analysis process: terminological extraction, computation of clusters and the strategic diagram. In particular, we explain the meaning of each parameter of the method: the choice of variables and similarity measures is discussed. Finally we try to give a global interpretation of the method in an economic context. Further studies will be added to this work in order to allow a generalisation of these results.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.80</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.3.80</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 3 (2004); 80-87</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.80/275</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.3.80</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The main objective of this research is to quantify uncertainties about impacts of malaria on mortality. A multivariate spatial regression model was developed for estimation of the risk of mortality associated with malaria across Ogun State in Nigeria, West Africa. We characterize different local governments in the data and model the spatial structure of the mortality data in infants and pregnant women. A flexible Bayesian hierarchical model was considered for a space-time series of counts (mortality) by constructing a likelihood-based version of a generalized Poisson regression model that combines methods for point-level misaligned data and change of support regression. A simple two-stage procedure for producing maps of predicted risk is described. Logistic regression modeling was used to determine an approximate risk on a larger scale, and geo-statistical (\"Kriging\") approaches were used to improve prediction at a local level. The results suggest improvement of risk prediction brought about in the second stage. The advantages and shortcomings of this approach highlight the need for further development of a better analytical methodology.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.145</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.145</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); 145-153</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.145/358</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.145</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Such usage scenarios, however, require additional facilities to enable automated data management with PIDs. In this article, we present a conceptual framework that is based on the idea of using common abstract data types (ADTs) in combination with PIDs. This provides a well-defined interface layer that abstracts from both underlying PID systems and higher-level applications. Our practical implementation is based on the Handle System, yet the fundamental concept of PID-based ADTs is transferable to other infrastructures, and it is well suited to achieve interoperability between them.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-01-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12-058</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.12-058</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013); 191-206</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12-058/50</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.12-058</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Although collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation approaches perform well in some applications, they do not produce satisfactory recommendations for academic items because they fail to reflect researchers’ unique characteristics in terms of authority, popularity, recentness, etc. In this paper, we propose two novel data structures, ALVector, which expresses various objective attributes of an article, and AUVector, which expresses users’ subjective weights for different attributes. Then, we propose a novel personalization-oriented recommendation method that utilizes both the content and non-content attributes in ALVector and AUVector for making recommendations. In order to make the overall best recommendation, the VIKOR algorithm is used with a personalization-oriented method to achieve a compromise solution. A real-world literature data set is used in the experiments. The experimental results show that our method better meets the user’s preference in multiple dimensions simultaneously.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-017</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-017</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 17</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-017/577</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-017/578</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-017</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-017</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Considering the reality of China, some potential solution have been proposed, which include changing the scheme of data integration, perfecting metadata and documentation, emphasizing data service, simplifying the application procedure, enhancing the shared consciousness in science and technology fields, establishing national data centers, and realizing sustainable data sharing.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-05-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S250</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S250</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S250-S254</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S250/407</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S250</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, because of financial limits or lack of capability to collect data, required published materials and even restricted materials and developing information from research projects often could not be obtained. The rise of digital techniques and Internet opportunities has allowed data resource sharing of philosophy research. However, although there are several ICPs with large-scale comprehensive commercial databases in the field in China, no real non-profit professional database for philosophy researchers exists. Therefore, in 2002, the Philosophy Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences began a project to build \"The Database of Philosophy Research.\" Until Mar. 2006 the number of subsets had reached 30, with more than 30,000 records, retrieval services reached 6,000, and article-reading reached 30,000. Because of the concept of intellectual property, the service of the database is currently limited to the information held in CASS. Nevertheless, this is the first academic database for philosophy research, so its orientation is towards resource-sharing, leading users to data, and serving large number of demands from other provinces and departments.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S968</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S968</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S968-S972</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S968/522</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S968</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

On the other hand, the scientific climate community requests early citations on evolving data for credit, e.g. for CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6). The data citation concept for CMIP6 is presented. The main challenges lie in limited resources, a strict project timeline and the dependency on changes of the data dissemination infrastructure ESGF (Earth System Grid Federation) to meet the data citation requirements. Therefore a pragmatic, flexible and extendible approach for the CMIP6 data citation service was developed, consisting of a citation for the full evolving data superset and a data cart approach for citing the concrete used data subset. This two citation approach can be implemented according to the RDA recommendations for evolving data. Because of resource constraints and missing project policies, the implementation of the second part of the citation concept is postponed to CMIP7. </dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-06-15</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-030</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-030</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 30</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-030/686</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-030/687</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-030/261</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-030/262</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-030/263</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-030/264</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-030</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-030</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This is due to increased demands by governments and other funding agencies to have research data archived and shared as widely as possible. This paper sought to establish the data sharing practices of researchers in South Africa. The study further sought to establish the level of collaboration among researchers in sharing research data at the university level. The outcomes of the survey will help the researchers to develop appropriate data literacy awareness programmes meant to stimulate growth in data sharing practices for the benefit of research, not only in South Africa, but the world at large. A survey research method was used to gather data from willing public universities in South Africa. A similar study was conducted in other countries such as the United Kingdom, France and Turkey but the Researchers believe that circumstances in the developed world may differ with the South African research environment, hence the current study. The major finding of this study was that most researchers preferred to use data produced by others but less keen on sharing their own data. This study is the first of its kind in South Africa which investigates data sharing practices of researchers from multi-disciplinary fields at the university level and will contribute immensely to the growing body of literature in the area of research data management.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-07-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-028</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-028</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 28</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-028/855</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-028/856</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-028</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-028</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This paper begins with the effects of cyclones on regional and global economies. Then a brief introduction to the past and current situations and progress in cyclones forecasting and warning in China are presented. Finally the paper gives recommendations about improving and perfecting the tropical cyclone forecasting and warning systems.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S723</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S723</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S723-S737</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S723/490</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S723</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

First, the formal expert’s opinions are more fully expressed, and this is realized with the more complex measures of activity (the concept of straightenings (Gvishiani et al. 2003; Gvishiani et al. 2004; Zlotnicki et al. 2005) is replaced by the measures of activity which come to the fore): second, for the junction of anomalies, a recently created DPS (Discrete Perfect Sets) algorithm is used DPS (Discrete Perfect Sets) (Agayan et al. 2011; Agayan et al. 2014).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor

The strategic initiative EnviDat highlights the importance WSL lays on Research Data Management (RDM) at the institutional level and demonstrates the commitment to accessible research data in order to advance environmental science.EnviDat focuses on registering and publishing environmental data sets and provides unified and efficient access to the WSL’s comprehensive reservoir of environmental monitoring and research data. Research data management is organized in a decentralized manner where the responsibility to curate research data remains with the experts and the original data providers.EnviDat supports data producers and data users in registration, documentation, storage, publication, search and retrieval of a wide range of heterogeneous data sets from the environmental domain. Innovative features include (i) a flexible, three-layer metadata schema, (ii) an additive data discovery model that considers spatial data and (iii) a DataCRediT mechanism designed for specifying data authorship. In addition, the overall user-friendly appearance in EnviDat provides an important opportunity for showcasing WSL research activities and results. The EnviDat portal builds on a conceptual system consisting of a core system, a set of guiding principles and a number of key services. Its development closely follows the conceptual framework, being guided by principles towards the ultimate goal of providing useful services for researchers.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-10-18</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-028</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-028</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 28</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-028/787</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-028/788</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1096</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1097</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1098</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1099</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1100</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1101</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1102</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-028/1230</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-028</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-028</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Given the importance of instruments and associated metadata to the assessment of data quality and data reuse, globally unique, persistent and resolvable identification of instruments is crucial. The Research Data Alliance Working Group Persistent Identification of Instruments (PIDINST) developed a community-driven solution for persistent identification of instruments which we present and discuss in this paper. Based on an analysis of 10 use cases, PIDINST developed a metadata schema and prototyped schema implementation with DataCite and ePIC as representative persistent identifier infrastructures and with HZB (Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und Energie) and BODC (British Oceanographic Data Centre) as representative institutional instrument providers. These implementations demonstrate the viability of the proposed solution in practice. Moving forward, PIDINST will further catalyse adoption and consolidate the schema by addressing new stakeholder requirements.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-05-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-018</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-018</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 18</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-018/962</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-018/963</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-018/2337</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-018</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-018</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The ESG uses fuzzy-logic based search tools to allow a user to look for specific environmental scenarios in vast archives by specifying the search in human linguistic terms. For example, the user can specify a scenario such as a \"cloud free week\" or \"high winds and low pressure\" and then search relevant archives available across the network to get a list of matching events. The ESG hooks to existing archives of data by providing a simple communication framework and an efficient data model for exchanging data. Once data has been delivered by the distributed archives in the ESG data model, it can easily be accessed by the visualization, integration and analysis components to meet specific user requests. The ESG implementation provides a framework which can be taken as a pattern applicable to other distributed archive systems.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.10</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.3.10</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 3 (2004); 10-28</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.10/266</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.3.10</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Medical data mining has been a popular data mining topic of late. Compared with other data mining areas, medical data mining has some unique characteristics. Because medical files are related to human subjects, privacy concerns are taken more seriously than other data mining tasks. This paper applied data separation-based techniques to preserve privacy in classification of medical data. We take two approaches to protect privacy: one approach is to vertically partition the medical data and mine these partitioned data at multiple sites; the other approach is to horizontally split data across multiple sites. In the vertical partition approach, each site uses a portion of the attributes to compute its results, and the distributed results are assembled at a central trusted party using a majority-vote ensemble method. In the horizontal partition approach, data are distributed among several sites. Each site computes its own data, and a central trusted party is responsible to integrate these results. We implement these two approaches using medical datasets from UCI KDD archive and report the experimental results.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-08-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S429</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S429</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S429-S434</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S429/430</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S429</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Data Sharing Network of Earth System Science (DSNESS) is one of the nine pilot projects of the Scientific Data Sharing Project in China that has become a long-term operational research data-sharing platform in the National Science and Technology Infrastructure (NSTI) of China. First, a data sharing union mechanism was designed with the core principle being, “data come from research and will be reused in research”. Second, a data sharing organizational architecture was constructed that consists of three sections: data resource architecture, data management architecture, and data services architecture. A physical data sharing network was constructed that includes one general center and 15 distributed sub-centers based on the architecture. Third, a series of data sharing standards and specifications were designed and implemented in the DSNESS. The reference model of the DSNESS standard system includes three levels of standards: directive standards, general standards, and application standards. In total, 21 high level standards and specifications were developed and implemented in the DSNESS. Several core standards and specifications, such as the extensible metadata standard, data quality control specifications, and so on, were analyzed in detail. Finally, the data service effect was summarized in three aspects: dataset services, standard and specification services, and international cooperation services. This research shows that the organizational architecture and standard system is a very important soft environment for research data sharing. The practices of DSNESS will provide useful experiences for multi-disciplinary data sharing in Earth science and will help to eliminate the data gap between the rich and poor at the national level.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-09-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-031</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.13-031</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013); 91-101</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.13-031/41</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.13-031</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Datanature (all data in cyberspace) is forming due to a data explosion. Exploring the patterns and rules in datanature is necessary but difficult. A new discipline called Data Science is coming. It provides a type of novel research method (a data-intensive method) for natural and social sciences and goes beyond computer science in researching data. This paper presents the challenges presented by data and discusses what differentiates data science from the established sciences, data technologies, and big data.

During the International Polar Year (IPY 2007–2008), a remarkable number of data/metadata involving multi-disciplinary science activities were compiled. Although the long-term stewardship of the accumulation of metadata falls to the data center of NIPR, the work has been in collaboration with the Global Change Master Directory, the Polar Information Commons, the World Data System and other data science bodies/communities under the International Council for Science. In addition, links with other data centers, such as the Data Integration and Analysis System Program of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems and the Polar Data Catalogue of Canada were initiated in 2014 using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. The metadata compiled by the PDC were recently modified using an automatic attributing system and DataCite through the Japan Link Center.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-01-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-001</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-001</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 1</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-001/733</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-001/734</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-001</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-001</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">polar region</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">from IGY to present</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">various science research disciplines (space and upper atmospheric sciences, meteorology and glaciology, geosciences and biosciences)</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Where OAIS compliant digital preservation has been established in recent years, in almost all cases the services aim at the preservation of file-based objects. In the Digital Humanities, research data is often represented in highly structured aggregations, such as Scholarly Digital Editions. Naturally, scholars would like their editions to remain functionally complete as long as possible. Besides standard components like webservers, the presentation typically relies on project specific code interacting with client software like webbrowsers. Especially the latter being subject to rapid change over time invariably makes such environments awkward to maintain once funding has ended. Pragmatic approaches have to be found in order to balance the curation effort and the maintainability of access to research data over time.A sketch of four potential service levels aiming at the long-term availability of research data in the humanities is outlined: (1) Continuous Maintenance, (2) Application Conservation, (3) Application Data Preservation, and (4) Bitstream Preservation. The first being too costly and the last hardly satisfactory in general, we suggest that the implementation of services by an infrastructure provider should concentrate on service levels 2 and 3. We explain their strengths and limitations considering the example of two Scholarly Digital Editions.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-10-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-051</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-051</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 51</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-051/902</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-051/903</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-051/1121</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-051/1122</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-051/1123</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-051/1124</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-051/1500</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-051/1501</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-051</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-051</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Linked Open Data Cloud project at present is the major effort to implement the concepts of the Seamtic Web, addressing the problems of inhomogeneity and large data volumes. RKBExplorer is one of many repositories implementing Open Data and contains considerable bibliographic information. This paper discusses bibliographic data, an important part of cloud data. Effective searching of bibiographic datasets can be a challenge as many of the papers residing in these databases do not have sufficient or comprehensive keyword information. In these cases however, a search engine based on RKBExplorer is only able to use information to retrieve papers based on author names and title of papers without keywords. In this paper we attempt to address this problem by using the data mining algorithm Association Rule Mining (ARM) to develop keywords based on features retrieved from Resource Description Framework (RDF) data within a bibliographic citation. We have demonstrate the applicability of this method for predicting missing keywords for bibliographic entries in several typical databases.−−−−−Paper presented at 1st International Symposium on Big Data and Cloud Computing Challenges (ISBCC-2014) March 27-28, 2014.

As for distributed spatial datasets, the current centralized administrative scheme may become the system performance bottleneck. This paper presents a distributed cooperative grid computing technology to facilitate complex spatial applications by collaboration among distributed spatial resources. A hierarchical spatial index and communication protocol has been designed for the collaboration, which enables a dynamical choice for the best quality nodes for specified subtasks, synchronized execution, and compensation for a failure to execute a subtask. Also, we present an approach for dynamic resource allocation and distributed transaction mechanics to ensure consistency.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-12</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S889</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S889</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S889-S897</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S889/513</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S889</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

DataSHIELD (Data Aggregation Through Anonymous Summary-statistics from Harmonised Individual-levEL Databases) is a distributed approach that allows the analysis of sensitive individual-level data from one study, and the co-analysis of such data from several studies simultaneously without physically pooling them or disclosing any data. Following initial proof of principle, a stable DataSHIELD platform has now been implemented in a number of epidemiological consortia. This paper reports three new applications of DataSHIELD including application to post-publication sensitive data analysis, text data analysis and privacy protected data visualisation. Expansion of DataSHIELD analytic functionality and application to additional data types demonstrate the broad applications of the software beyond biomedical sciences. </dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-021</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-021</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 21</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-021/667</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-021/668</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/331</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/332</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/333</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/334</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/335</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/336</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/337</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/338</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-021/339</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-021</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-021</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The CR equals the total number of citations of a publication divided by the median of citations of its references and was tested for the top 5% of the most-cited publications of 13 selected disciplines in sciences, social sciences and humanities. Each publication had a CR = 0 until it was firstly cited. At CR = 1 the number of citations equalled the median of citations of the references. CRs of the most-cited publications mostly ranged between 1 and 10 and were not significantly different across the selected disciplines. In contrast, the total number of citations of the same publications were significantly different across disciplines. One of the advantages of the CR is that it can be calculated for any publication as long as it has references (e.g. books, book chapters, reports, and symposium contributions).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-05-27</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-019</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-019</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 19</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-019/837</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-019/838</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-019/703</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-019/1714</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-019</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-019</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">International</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The data flood has outpaced our capability to process, manage, analyze, and provide intelligent services. Extracting valuable information from the huge data ocean is necessary for improving the quality of domain services. The most acute information management challenges today stem from organizations relying on amounts of diverse, interrelated data sources, but having no way to manage the dataspaces in an integrated, user-demand driven and services convenient way. Thus, we proposed the model of Virtual DataSpace (VDS) in materials science field to organize multi-source and heterogeneous data resources and offer services on the data in place without losing context information. First, the concept and theoretical analysis are described for the model. Then the methods for construction of the model is proposed based on users’ interests. Furthermore, the dynamic evolution algorithm of VDS is analyzed using the user feedback mechanism. Finally, we showed its efficiency for intelligent, real-time, on-demand services in the field of materials engineering.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-07-08</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-007</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2016-007</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 7</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-007/595</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-007/596</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/148</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/149</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/150</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/151</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/152</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-007/153</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-007</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2016-007</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, little is known about the total size, characteristics, and sustainability of these data. In the scholarly sphere, it is widely suspected that there is a gap between the amount of valuable digital data that is produced and the amount that is effectively stewarded and made accessible. The Stewardship Gap Project (http://bit.ly/stewardshipgap) investigates characteristics of, and measures, the stewardship gap for sponsored scholarly activity in the United States. This paper presents a preliminary definition of the stewardship gap based on a review of relevant literature and investigates areas of the stewardship gap for which metrics have been developed and measurements made, and where work to measure the stewardship gap is yet to be done. The main findings presented are 1) there is not one stewardship gap but rather multiple “gaps” that contribute to whether data is responsibly stewarded; 2) there are relationships between the gaps that can be used to guide strategies for addressing the various stewardship gaps; and 3) there are imbalances in the types and depths of studies that have been conducted to measure the stewardship gap.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-08-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-019</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-019</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 19</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-019/769</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-019/770</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-019/696</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-019/697</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-019/698</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-019/699</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-019/1078</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-019</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-019</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Primarily North America and Europe</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Most recent fifteen years</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Review of significant literature</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, there is a lack of attention to scientific data even when scientists and researchers are facing an increasing data deluge. In this study, we carried out a two-phase (first exploratory and then empirical) research to explore relevance judgment patterns of scientific data users. In the exploratory study, we interviewed 23 subjects who participated in a national competition related to scientific data. Five relevance criteria (RC) and seven paths of their usage were identified by content analysis of the transcribed records of the interview. Based on the results of the first phase, seven hypotheses were proposed and verified by partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The study identified five RC, i.e. topicality, accessibility, authority, quality and usefulness used by scientific data users. Three patterns were identified including 1) data topicality judgment as the first step or starting point, 2) data reliability judgment as the necessary process and 3) data utility judgment as final purpose. These findings provide new understanding of relevance judgement and behaviours of scientific data users, and could benefit the design for cognitive retrieval systems and algorithms specific to scientific data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-03-09</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-009</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 9</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-009/941</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-009/942</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1878</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1879</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1880</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1881</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1882</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1883</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-009/1884</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-009</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-009</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Although group discussion is known to be effective for analyzing data from various viewpoints, the number of participants is limited by time and space constraints. To solve that problem, this paper proposes to augment a BBS, a popular web based tool. In order for discussion participants to share data online, the system provides them with a visual representation of target data, which elicits comments from participants as well as compares these comments. In order to illustrate the concept's potential, a BBS equipped with KeyGraph is also developed for supporting online chance discovery. It has functions for making visual annotations on the KeyGraph as well as a function for retrieving similar scenarios. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the BBS in terms of the usefulness of scenario generation support functions as well as that of scenario retrieval engines.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S28</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S28</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S28-S38</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S28/381</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S28</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It also reports a small-scale simulation study to indicate factors which can influence the bias correction to be small or large. For the complete data-set, it is observed that the maximum likelihood estimates and Schaefer's bias-corrected estimates are not greatly different. However, when the original sample size is reduced by about 50%, the difference between the estimates is found to be much larger, possibly even large enough to influence the conclusions drawn. The impact of transformation and categorization is visibly present. However, the broad impression gained in categorization is the same though difference in types of categorizations can not be overlooked. A factor which seems to influence the size of the bias correction is identified.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-07-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.100</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.100</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 100-107</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.100/462</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.100</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It is the largest low-dispersion spectroscopic survey of the sky, covering 17,000 square degrees at galactic latitudes |b|&amp;gt;15. DFBS provides images and extracted spectra for all objects present in the FBS plates. Programs were developed to compute astrometric solution, extract spectra, and apply wavelength and photometric calibration for objects. A DFBS database and catalog has been assembled containing data for nearly 20,000,000 objects. A classification scheme for the DFBS spectra is being developed. The Armenian Virtual Observatory is based on the DFBS database and other large-area surveys and catalogue data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-05-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-072</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.007-072</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 152-161</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-072/232</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.007-072</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We propose the core should be CERIF: an EU recommendation to member states for exchanging research information and for homogeneous access to heterogeneous information. CERIF can also integrate associated systems (such as finance, human resource, project management, and library services) and provides interoperation among research institutions, research funders, and innovators.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2010-04-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.CRIS1</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.CRIS1</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010): Special Issue; CRIS1-CRIS6</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.CRIS1/149</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.CRIS1</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Designing an immune algorithm is based on a sharing mechanism to extract rules. The principle of sharing and competing resources in the sharing mechanism is consistent with the relationship of sharing and rivalry among rules. In order to extract rules efficiently, a new concept of flexible confidence and rule measurement is introduced. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective.  </dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-12-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S824</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S824</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S824-S830</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S824/504</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S824</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

While there have been many conceptual frameworks developed and case reports of individual archives and digital repositories, there have been few empirical studies of how such archives persist over time. In this paper, we draw upon organizational studies theories to approach the issue of sustainability from an organizational perspective, focusing specifically on the organizational histories of three social science data archives (SSDA): ICPSR, UKDA, and LIS. Using a framework of organizational resilience to understand how archives perceive crisis, respond to it, and learn from experience, this article reports on an empirical study of sustainability in these long-lived SSDAs. The study draws from archival documents and interviews to examine how sustainability can and should be conceptualized as on-going processes over time and not as a quality at a single moment. Implications for research and practice in data archive sustainability are discussed.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-012</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-012</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 12</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-012/648</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-012/649</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-012</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-012</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">1960s-1980s</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The assumption is that reuse or secondary use of research data saves researchers time in not having to produce data for a publication themselves. This can make science more efficient and productive. However, if there is no reuse, time costs in making data available for reuse will have been made with no return on this investment. In this paper a mathematical model is used to calculate the break-even point for time spent sharing in a scientific community, versus time gain by reuse. This is done for several scenarios; from simple to complex datasets to share and reuse, and at different sharing rates. The results indicate that sharing research data can indeed cause an efficiency revenue for the scientific community. However, this is not a given in all modeled scenarios. The scientific community with the lowest reuse needed to reach a break-even point is one that has few sharing researchers and low time investments for sharing and reuse. This suggests it would be beneficial to have a critical selection of datasets that are worth the effort to prepare for reuse in other scientific studies. In addition, stimulating reuse of datasets in itself would be beneficial to increase efficiency in scientific communities.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-03-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-010</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-010</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 10</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-010/819</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-010/820</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-010/1154</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-010/1487</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-010/1488</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-010/1489</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-010/1490</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-010</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-010</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This requires that data are findable and accessible on the Web, and comply with shared standards making them interoperable and reusable in alignment with the FAIR principles. It takes considerable time, energy, expertise and motivation. It is imperative to facilitate the processes to encourage scientists to share their data. To that aim, supporting FAIR principles compliance processes and increasing the human understanding of FAIRness criteria – i.e., promoting FAIRness literacy – and not only the machine-readability of the criteria, are critical steps in the data sharing process. Appropriate human-understandable criteria must be the first identified in the FAIRness assessment processes and roadmap. This paper reports on the lessons learned from the RDA SHARC Interest Group on identifying the processes required to prepare FAIR implementation in various communities not specifically data skilled, and on the procedures and training that must be deployed and adapted to each practice and level of understanding. These are essential milestones in developing adapted support and credit back mechanisms not yet in place.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-08-11</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-032</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-032</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 32</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-032/988</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-032/989</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2271</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2272</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2273</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2274</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2275</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2276</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2534</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2535</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2536</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2537</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2538</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2539</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2540</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2594</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2595</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2596</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2597</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-032/2598</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-032</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-032</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">International</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Work done in RDA SHARC interest group (BoF april 2017)</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">NA</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This is the NBS where MET Norway has the technical responsibility in terms of providing the infrastructure and storage capacity for data management. Serving the data through two separate platforms, the end users have access to the data in its original format in addition to Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 products in NetCDF-4/CF. Using the latter format, services like regridding, subsetting, visualization and aggregation are integrated utilizing OPeNDAP in combination with OGC WMS and OGC WPS. In addition, data uploading and retrieving operations are simplified for an end user since streaming of data by means of OPeNDAP is supported in multiple programming languages. Due to the strong coupling between space based earth observations, in-situ observation, model data etc, disseminating data in a generic data management system utilizing NetCDF-4/CF and OPeNDAP is convenient for seamless integration across branches. However, the current CF version is not mature for handling all parts of the Sentinel data but future development looks very promising.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-12-27</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-061</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-061</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 61</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-061/923</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-061/924</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-061/1441</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-061/1442</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-061/1443</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-061/1444</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-061/2078</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-061</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-061</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">POLYGON((-10.56562687447763 58.280616106607425,32.55355307271472 58.280616106607425,32.55355307271472 81.28322827667432,-10.56562687447763 81.28322827667432,-10.56562687447763 58.280616106607425))</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Strain data are good examples of such disturbed signals. To determine the geodetic strain behavior before and after the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake (M8.0), we decomposed the disturbed strain data into trend, air pressure, earth tide, and precipitation responses components. The decomposition of the disturbed strain data and the interpolation of the missing observations are performed very effectively by using state-space modeling and the Kalman filter/smoother. The validity of the data processing is confirmed by the fact that the model derived to fit the strain data matches the GPS data extremely well.  1The following contribution was presented at the WDS conference and presents a more complete explanation of the data processing and its implementation. Subsequent to the Conference, the authors completed their research and have published a comprehensive paper presenting their final results in [Modeling of the post-seismic slip of the 2003 Tokachi-oki earthquake M8 off Hokkaido: constraints from volumetric strain, Earth, Planets and Space, doi: 10.5047/eps.2012.12.003, in press]. That paper includes not only a preliminary data processing presented here, but also contains many additional results concerned with a geophysical phenomenon. The CODATA Data Science Journal regrets the delay in publishing this conference paper.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-04-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-038</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-038</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS216-WDS220</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-038/144</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-038</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Such resources are now primarily provided through High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities. As a result of a global increase in availability and accessibility of supercomputing HPC facilities, numerical models that can now be employed have become more complex. Furthermore, resolutions now used and achievable have increased significantly.The Southern African Development Community (SADC) Cyber-Infrastructure (CI) Framework aims to build increased capacity in regional research and education networks, data sharing infrastructure and trained human capital – to make efficient and effective use of the CI resources. Through the implementation of the regional CI framework and national initiatives, several member states in Southern Africa now have HPC facilities. The availability of this infrastructure in the region provides opportunities for domains, domain scientists and collaboration through research and development projects. For meteorology, this will support more local and regional weather and climate scientists. For meteorological services, this will mean increased in-house and in-country capacity to run models, with less reliance on external resources from developed countries. This paper discusses a regional weather and climate implementation project of the SADC CI.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-07-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-034</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-034</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 34</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-034/867</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-034/868</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1446</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1447</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1448</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1449</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1450</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1495</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1725</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1726</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1727</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1728</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1729</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1730</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1731</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1732</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-034/1771</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-034</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-034</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Data management brings in additional challenges due to the time aspect. While a computing centre or network technology might be considered obsolete after a few years, data management requirements often extend decades or even centuries into the future. Funding commitments need to be made for long periods of time, and decisions about sustainability and governance models could be seen as setting a precedent that ties down parties for years into the future. At the same time, it is anticipated that the amount of data being produced will continue to exceed the capacity of the managed (curated and otherwise maintained) data services, adding the need to discuss prioritisation of the different datasets.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-07-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-006</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-006</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; GRDI32-GRDI36</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-006/219</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-006</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The infrastructure and content of the applications determine the success of an e-government's implementation. Limitations of Internet access and people's awareness are the main problems in most developing countries, including Indonesia. Thus, the implementers of Indonesian e-government have to consider the social conditions and cultural behavior of their society. We propose the development of Community-based Information Systems (CIS) to empower the implementation of Indonesian e-government. A CIS is designed to take into account the Indonesian societal system, which is structured by communities. CIS is formatted based on one primary portal that groups numbers of community websites. In this paper, one pilot system is presented (www.nagari.org).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S79</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S79</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S79-S86</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S79/386</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S79</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We investigate in detail the properties of the RSL for a sample of nine LBs, using the general cross-correlation technique that includes the lag between two different energy bands. We find that the distribution of RSLs is normal and has a mean value of 0.1. Our important discovery is that redshift (z) and peak luminosity (Lp) are strongly correlated with the RSL, which can be measured easily and directly, making the RSL a good redshift and peak luminosity indicator. In addition, we find that the redshift and luminosity estimator can also hold for short gamma-ray bursts (SBs, T90 &amp;lt; 2.6 s). With it, we estimate the median of redshift and peak luminosity of SBs to be about z≤0.06 and Lp ∼1.68×1048 erg/s, which are in excellent agreement with the results suggested by some previous authors. We thus argue that the sources including SBs and LBs with positive spectral lags might be one united category with the same physical process.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-06-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S324</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S324</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S324-S332</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S324/417</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S324</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In the model, circular antenna arrays combining minimum norm (min-norm) and linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) algorithms have been used for signal anti-jamming. Six GPS signals' and two jammers' original incident direction were assumed respectively. The simulation was performed with a variation of the power of the two jammers and the element number of the circular antenna array. The simulation result indicates that by utilizing this new signal suppression model, nulls depths assigned to the jammer reach -238dBW when the number of element of circular antenna array is assumed to be 30. It also indicates that the stronger power of the jammer, the deeper nulls depths can be assigned with this new signal processing structure.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-11-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S782</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S782</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S782-S788</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S782/498</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S782</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We describe additions to a collection prepared for use in paleoclimate state estimation, specifically the Last Millennium Reanalysis (LMR). The 2290 additional series include 2152 tree ring chronologies and 138 other series. They supplement the collection used previously and together form a database titled LMRdb 1.0.0. The additional data draws from lake core, ice core, coral, speleothem, and tree ring archives, using published data primarily from the NOAA Paleoclimatology archive and a set of tree ring width chronologies standardized from raw International Tree Ring Data Bank ring width series. In contrast to many previous paleo compilations, the data were not selected (screened) on the basis of their environmental correlation, multi-century length, or other attributes. The inclusion of proxies sensitive to moisture and other environmental variables expands their use in data assimilation. A preliminary calibration using linear regression with mean annual temperature reveals characteristics of the proxy series and their relationship to temperature, as well as the noise and error characteristics of the records. The additional records are structured as individual files in the NOAA Paleoclimatology format and archived at NOAA Paleoclimatology (Anderson et al. 2018) and will continue to be improved and expanded as part of the LMR Project. The additions represent a four-fold increase in the number of records available for assimilation, provide expanded geographic coverage, and add additional proxy variables. Applications include data assimilation, proxy system model development, and paleoclimate reconstruction using climate field reconstruction and other methods.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-01-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-002</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-002</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 2</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-002/803</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-002/804</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1132</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1133</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1134</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1136</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1307</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1308</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1309</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1310</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-002/1311</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-002</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-002</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">global</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">last millennium, instrumental period</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The high quality magnetic field measurements from CHAMP made it possible to extract and clearly resolve Pi2 and Pc3 pulsations in LEO satellite data. Our analyses for nighttime Pi2 pulsations are indicative of a cavity mode resonance. However, observations of daytime Pi2 pulsation events identified in ground station data show no convincing evidence of their occurrence in CHAMP data. We also studied low-latitude Pc3 pulsations and found that different types of field line resonant structure occur, namely discrete frequencies driven by a narrow band source and L-dependent frequencies driven by a broad band source.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-06-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-03</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-03</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); IAGA10-IAGA18</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IAGA-03/82</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.IAGA-03</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

With the increased usage of such research information, the requirements for data quality and interpretation consistency are increasing. An agreed understanding of the concepts of research information is therefore crucial for fair science evaluation and science policy. Initiatives like euroCRIS and CASRAI address this by standardising research information definitions. In this paper, we present an approach to systematically develop and document not only definitions of research information, but also discussed alternatives and related arguments. With that we aim to support existing RI standardisation initatives with a flexible and scalable way of documenting and communicating the standardisation process in order to increase acceptance for the resulting definitions. Our contribution is threefold: Based on the widely used IBIS notation for argumentation modelling, we first introduce semantic rules for defining research information. Secondly, a transformation algorithm is provided to reduce the complexity of those argumentations – without the loss of information – and in turn improve readability of the diagrams. Thirdly, the semantic rules of the resulting less complex RIDAL notation are provided. The presented modelling notations are evaluated in the case setting of the standardisation project for research information of the German science system “Core Research Dataset”. </dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-02-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-005</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-005</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 5</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-005/630</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-005/631</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-005/196</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-005/197</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-005/198</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-005/199</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-005/200</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-005/201</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-005/202</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-005</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-005</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Focussing on a specific non-designated community, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five artists in relation to five works. Data reuse is a critical component of all these works. The qualitative content analysis brings to light agonistic-antagonistic practices in data reuse and shows multiple deconstructions of the notion of data value as it is portrayed in the data reuse literature. Finally, the paper brings to light the benefits of including such practices in the conceptualization of data curation.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-023</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-023</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 23</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-023/970</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-023/971</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-023</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-023</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It uses remotely located charge-coupled-device cameras equipped with active infrared illuminators to acquire video images of the driver. Various visual cues that typically characterize the level of alertness of a person are extracted in real time and systematically combined to infer the fatigue level of the driver. The visual cues employed characterize eyelid movement, gaze movement, head movement, and facial expression. A probabilistic model is developed to model human fatigue and to predict fatigue based on the visual cues obtained. The simultaneous use of multiple visual cues and their systematic combination yields a much more robust and accurate fatigue characterization than using a single visual cue.

Obtaining useful information from these big data is a crucial issue. The aim of this article is to solve the problem of recommending experts to provide peer reviews for universities and other scientific research institutions. Our proposed recommendation method has two stages. An information filtering method is first offered to identify proper experts as a candidate set. Then, an aggregation model with various constraints is suggested to recommend appropriate experts for each applicant. The proposed method has been implemented in an online research community, and the results exhibit that the proposed method is more effective than existing ones.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-016</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-016</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 16</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-016/559</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-016/560</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-016</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-016</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The extensive nature of the collection and the diverse and often remote nature of the source locations means that the cost of recreating the collection, if possible, would be $AU100Ms. The original samples were collected as part of either extensive government geological mapping programs or more specific scientific expeditions conducted for major Government initiatives. They are technically open to anyone (industry, educational institutions, the public), but are essentially unknown and almost impossible to access.Management of this collection was based on an aged card catalogue and ledger system developed in the pre-digital era. The aged management system, with increasing deterioration of the physical media, combined with loss of access to even some of the original contributors meant that rescue work was needed. Rescuing the collection made use of non-traditional means, including the extensive use of web-based citizen science and reference to a small number of onsite volunteers.Through essentially a volunteer effort, from a group more used to biology related items, the project has seen the transcription of some 40,000 sample metadata records (more than 2.5 times our current electronic holdings). This paper examines the process undertaken and advocates the approach that has made it successful. It promotes the value and benefits to Geoscience Australia, participating volunteers and potential users of the collection.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-11-14</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-057</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-057</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 57</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-057/914</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-057/916</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1599</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1600</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1601</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1602</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1603</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1604</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1605</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1606</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1607</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1608</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1609</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1610</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1611</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1612</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1613</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1614</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1615</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1616</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1617</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-057/1910</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-057</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-057</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Australia, Antarctic</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

An ontology grounded in description logics was developed based on the ISO 15926 data model to describe three types of sustainability science conceptualizations: situational knowledge, analytic methods, and scenario frameworks. Semantic statements were then created using this ontology to describe expert knowledge expressed in research proposals and papers related to sustainability science and in scenarios for achieving sustainable societies. Semantic matching based on logic and rule-based inference was used to quantify the conceptual overlap of semantic statements, which shows the semantic similarity of topics studied by different researchers in sustainability science, similarities that might be unknown to the researchers themselves.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-01-13</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.Kraines</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.Kraines</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010); 107-123</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.Kraines/135</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.Kraines</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper, we introduce SVM_Light, a freely available software package using support vector machines (SVM) for photometric redshift estimation. This technique shows its superiorities in accuracy and efficiency. It can be applied to huge volumes of datasets, and its efficiency is acceptable. When a large representative training set is available, the results of this method are superior to the best ones obtained from template fitting. The method is used on a sample of 73,899 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5. When applied to processed data sets, the RMS error in estimating redshifts is less than 0.03. The performances of various kernel functions and different parameter sets have been compared. Parameter selection and uniform data have also been discussed. Finally the strengths and weaknesses of the approach are summarized.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-08-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S474</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S474</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S474-S480</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S474/440</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S474</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

With the evolvement from database to big data, the schema matching has been enriched with various purposes and application contexts, ranging from data integration, to service integration, to semantic data clouding, until more recent exploratory data analysis over big data. These enriched contexts increase the demand for schema matching between semantic data-types, such as XML, RDF etc.The existing integration approaches have not dealt with the challenges of defining a relation between XML and other semantic data-types. To address these challenges, this paper studies the problem of schema mapping from XML to RDF in two folds. Firstly, testify the validity of single matcher in a column based manner for the semantic data types. Secondly, testify the validity of a highly configurable framework that utilizes hierarchical classification in order to construct a composable pipeline.We propose and implement a Reconfigurable pipeline for Semi-Automatic Schema Matching (REPSASM), which aims to solve the customizability of the matching problem by providing an environment in which a user can create, configure and experiment with their own schema-matching procedure.The experiments performed within this work show that the configurability and hierarchical classification improves the matching result, and it proposes an algorithm to automatically optimize such a hierarchy pipeline.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-06-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-025</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-025</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 25</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-025/849</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-025/850</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1519</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1520</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1521</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1522</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1523</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1524</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1525</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1526</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1527</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-025/1528</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-025</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-025</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It has five solar imaging telescopes that simultaneously observe the full-disk Sun at different wavelengths around the H-alpha absorption line or in different modes. Therefore, the FMT can measure the three-dimensional velocity field of moving structures on the full solar disk. The science target of the FMT is to monitor solar flares and erupting filaments continuously all over the solar disk and to investigate correlation between the characteristics of the erupting phenomena and the geoeffectiveness of the corresponding coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We are planning to start up a new worldwide project, the Continuous H-alpha Imaging Network (CHAIN) project, as an important IHY project of our observatories. As part of this project, we are examining the possibility of installing telescopes similar to the FMT in developing countries. We have selected Peru and Algeria as the countries where the first and second overseas FMTs will be installed, and we are aiming to start operation of these FMTs by the end of 2010 before the maximum phase of solar cycle 24. To create such an international network, it will be necessary to improve the information technologies applied in our observation-system. In this paper, we explain the current status and future areas of work regarding our system.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-04-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.S51</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.8.S51</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); S51-S58</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.S51/294</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.8.S51</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The knowledge about Germany’s federal system, which also entails the autonomy of the federal states regarding the higher education system, is fundamental to understand the different approaches towards RDM in Germany. The state initiatives of Thuringia, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Hesse are described to compare them to the state initiative (Landesinitiative NFDI) of Germany’s most populous state of North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW). The aim of the initiative in NRW is to initiate the collaboration between institutions, to link current RDM activities in NRW and to prepare the local institutions for the participation in a National Research Data Infrastructure (Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur, NFDI).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-10-04</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-025</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-025</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 25</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-025/781</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-025/782</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-025</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-025</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It is well-known for the Weibull distribution that a joint conjugate prior on the parameters does not exist; we use both the informative and noninformative priors on the model parameters. Bayes estimates under LINEX and general entropy loss functions are obtained using the Gibbs sampling scheme. A simulation study is carried out to observe the behavior of the proposed estimators for different sample sizes and for different censoring parameters. It is observed that the Bayes estimators under LINEX and general entropy loss functions can be used effectively with the appropriate choice of respective loss function parameters. One real data set is analyzed for illustrative purposes.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-04-13</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.012-004</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.012-004</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 11 (2012); 72-88</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.012-004/49</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.012-004</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Concept Clustering Algorithm combines common phrase discovery and latent semantic indexing techniques to separate search results into meaningful groups. It looks for meaningful phrases to use as cluster labels and then assigns documents to the labels to form groups. The labels assigned to each document cluster provide meaningful information on the various documents available under that cluster. This provides a more interactive and easier way to probe through search results and identifying the relevant documents for the users using the search engine.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-09-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.91</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.91</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); 91-98</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.91/345</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.91</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In the literature, multiple imputation is known to be the standard method to handle missing data. While the theory of multiple imputation has been known for decades, the implementation is difficult due to the complicated nature of random draws from the posterior distribution. Thus, there are several computational algorithms in software: Data Augmentation (DA), Fully Conditional Specification (FCS), and Expectation-Maximization with Bootstrapping (EMB). Although the literature is full of comparisons between joint modeling (DA, EMB) and conditional modeling (FCS), little is known about the relative superiority between the MCMC algorithms (DA, FCS) and the non-MCMC algorithm (EMB), where MCMC stands for Markov chain Monte Carlo. Based on simulation experiments, the current study contends that EMB is a confidence proper (confidence-supporting) multiple imputation algorithm without between-imputation iterations; thus, EMB is more user-friendly than DA and FCS.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-07-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-037</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-037</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 37</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-037/701</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-037/702</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-037/424</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-037</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-037</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Cloud computing has the advantage of high scalability and reliability, which can provide firm technical support. This paper proposes a highly scalable geospatial cloud platform named the Geospatial Data Cloud, which is constructed based on cloud computing. The architecture of the platform is first introduced, and then two subsystems, the cloud-based data management platform and the cloud-based data processing platform, are described. –––This paper was presented at the First Scientific Data Conference on Scientific Research, Big Data, and Data Science, organized by CODATA-China and held in Beijing on 24-25 February, 2014.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-11-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-042</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-042</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 254-264</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-042/17</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-042</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Strengthening international data sharing networks will not only demand advancing technical, legal, and logistical infrastructure for publishing data in open, accessible formats; it will also require recognizing, respecting, and learning to work across diverse data cultures. This essay introduces a heuristic for pursuing richer characterizations of the “data cultures” at play in international, interdisciplinary data sharing. The heuristic prompts cultural analysts to query the contexts of data sharing for a particular discipline, institution, geography, or project at seven scales – the meta, macro, meso, micro, techno, data, and nano. The essay articulates examples of the diverse cultural forces acting upon and interacting with researchers in different communities at each scale. The heuristic we introduce in this essay aims to elicit from researchers the beliefs, values, practices, incentives, and restrictions that impact how they think about and approach data sharing – not in an effort to iron out differences between disciplines, but instead to showcase and affirm the diversity of traditions and modes of analysis that have shaped how data gets collected, organized, and interpreted in diverse settings.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-09-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-048</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-048</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 48</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-048/896</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-048/897</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-048/1778</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-048/1863</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-048</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-048</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

As producers, researchers want to believe that they produce high quality data; as consumers, they want to obtain data of the highest quality. Data centres typically have stringent controls to ensure that they only acquire and disseminate data of the highest quality. Data managers will usually say that they improve the quality of the data they are responsible for. Much of the infrastructure that will emit, transform, integrate, visualise, manage, analyse, and disseminate data during its life will have dependencies, explicit or implicit, on the quality of the data it is dealing with.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-07-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-011</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-011</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; GRDI65-GRDI68</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-011/233</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-011</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The goal was to develop common requirements and primitives for a next-generation database management system that scientists would use, including those from high-energy physics, astronomy, biology, geoscience and fusion, in order to stimulate research and advance technology. These requirements were thought by the database researchers to be novel and unlikely to be fully met by current commercial vendors.

However, in reality there are no power stations that have been fully automated. This paper proposes a control system based on Multi-Agent Theory, including a management agent, communication agent, control agent, echo agent, and so on. These agents are able to harmonize automation and intelligence to provide effective control of the running of a hydropower station.

However, conventional ESN predictions require a large volume of training samples. Meanwhile, the time sequence data are complicated and unstable, resulting in insufficient learning of this network and difficult training. As a result, the accuracies of conventional ESN predictions are limited. Aimed at this issue, a time series prediction model of Grey Wolf optimized ESN has been proposed. Wout of ESN was optimized using the Grey Wolf algorithm and predictions of time series data were achieved using simplified training. The results indicated that the optimized time series prediction method exhibits superior prediction accuracy at a small sample size, compared with conventional prediction methods.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-05-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-016</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-016</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 16</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-016/831</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-016/832</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1019</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1020</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1021</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1022</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1023</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1024</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1025</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-016/1026</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-016</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-016</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The main objective of this approach in the geoscience domain is the improvement of understanding, integration, and usage of Earth and space science related web content in terms of data, information, and knowledge for machines and people. The modeling and representation of semantic attributes and relations within and among documents can be realized by human readable concept maps and machine readable OWL documents. The objectives for the usage of the Semantic Web approach in the GFZ data center ISDC project are the design of an extended classification of metadata documents for product types related to instruments, platforms, and projects as well as the integration of different types of metadata related to data product providers, users, and data centers. Sources of content and semantics for the description of Earth and space science product types and related classes are standardized metadata documents (e.g., DIF documents), publications, grey literature, and Web pages. Other sources are information provided by users, such as tagging data and social navigation information. The integration of controlled vocabularies as well as folksonomies plays an important role in the design of well formed ontologies.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2012-10-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.IGY-014</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.IGY-014</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 11 (2012): Special Issue; S140-S153</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>en</dc:language><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Our emphasis is mainly on catalogs of radio continuum sources observed from 10 MHz to 245 GHz, and secondly on catalogs of objects such as radio and active stars, X-ray binaries, planetary nebulae, HII regions, supernova remnants, pulsars, nearby and radio galaxies, AGN and quasars. CATS also includes the catalogs from the largest extragalactic surveys with non-radio waves. In 2008 CATS comprised a total of about 109 records from over 400 catalogs in the radio, IR, optical and X-ray windows, including most source catalogs deriving from observations with the Russian radio telescope RATAN-600. CATS offers several search tools through different ways of access, e.g. via Web-interface and e-mail. Since its creation in 1997 CATS has managed about 105requests. Currently CATS is used by external users about 1500 times per day and since its opening to the public in 1997 has received about 4000 requests for its selection and matching tasks.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-03-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.34</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.8.34</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 34-40</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.34/201</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.8.34</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The policy reaffirmed the principle that data should be made as widely and freely available as possible while safeguarding the privacy of research participants, and protecting confidential and proprietary data. Restricted availability of unique resources upon which further studies are dependent can impede the advancement of research and the delivery of medical care. Therefore, research data supported with NIH funds should be made readily available for research purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community. One approach to sharing data is to establish a network of databases. However, there are a number of barriers to creating successful networks, which can include fundamental differences in informatics infrastructure and communication tools used at various research sites. Solutions will entail standards for data collection, processing, and archiving to allow interoperability among the databases and the ability to query data across databases. Open architectures for data collection as well as software to facilitate communication across different databases are needed.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-06-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.OD54</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.OD54</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007): Special Issue; OD54-OD57</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.OD54/368</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.OD54</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The three methods are multi-level logistic regression, spatial logistic regression, and spatial Poison regression, all proposed since 2010. Diabetes prevalence is estimated for each county in the continental United States from the 2012 sample of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The mapping results show that all three methods displayed elevated diabetes prevalence in the South. While the Pearson correlation coefficients among three model-based estimates were all above 0.60, the highest one was 0.80 between the multilevel and spatial logistic methods. While point estimates are apparently different among the three small area estimate methods, their top and bottom of quintile distributions are fairly consistent based on Bangdiwala’s B-statistic, suggesting that outputs from each method would support consistent policy making in terms of identifying top and bottom percent counties. </dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-04-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-008</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-008</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 8</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-008/747</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-008/748</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-008/772</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-008/773</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-008/774</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-008/775</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-008/934</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-008</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-008</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">United States</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">2012</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This low overhead compression mechanism provides block-by-block and record-by-record compression by using tuple difference coding techniques, thereby maximizing the compression ratio and minimizing the decompression penalty at run-time. The experimental results demonstrate that the typical compression ratio is about 30:1 without sacrificing running time. This paper also demonstrates that the compression method is suitable for Hilbert Space Filling Curve, a mechanism widely used in multi-dimensional indexing.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S184</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S184</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S184-S197</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S184/400</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S184</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

There are currently many different methods in use for optimizing digital objects for research purposes. These methods have been applied to many scientific disciplines but differ in architecture and approach. The goals of this joint digital research object (DRO) conference were to discuss the challenge of characterizing DROs at scale in volume and over time and possible organizing principles that might connect current DRO architectures. One of the primary challenges concerns convincing scientists that these tools and practices will actually make the research process easier and more fruitful. This conference included work from CENDI, the National Federal STI Managers Group, the National Federation of Advanced Information Services (NFAIS), the Research Data Alliance (RDA), and the National Academy of Science (NAS).</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-06-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-016</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-016</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 16</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-016/763</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-016/764</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-016</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-016</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The large amounts of different data types found in both databases are stored in a highly structured and uniform manner and this structured organisation means that SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL together provide a comprehensive resource with data that are readily accessible for users and easily retrievable by computer programs.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.1.13</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.1.13</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 1, No 1 (2002); 13-18</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.1.13/168</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.1.13</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Analysts are struggling to use complex techniques such as time series analysis and classification algorithms because their familiar, powerful tools are not scalable and cannot effectively use scalable database systems. The 2nd Extremely Large Databases (XLDB) workshop was organized to understand these issues, examine their implications, and brainstorm possible solutions. The design of a new open source science database, SciDB that emerged from the first workshop in this series was also debated. This paper is the final report of the discussions and activities at this workshop.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-03-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.196</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.7.196</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 7 (2008); 196-208</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.196/336</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.7.196</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Established services such as DataCite, Crossref, ORCID and ISNI are providing a foundation for a trusted ecosystem and a new generation of services. Scalable identifier systems will support researchers and capture research activity in a holistic way, across the entire lifecycle. Challenges remain – siloed services are not interoperable; important types of objects are not adequately covered, many processes remain manual, and adoption, while strong, is not consistent across disciplines.This article draws on the work of the EU-funded THOR project to take stock of the current state of interoperability across the PID landscape and to discuss the next steps towards an integrated research record. Examples illustrate how this interconnectivity is facilitated technically, as well as social and human challenges in fostering adoption. User stories highlight how this network of persistent identifier services is facilitating good practice in open research and where its limitations lie.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-06-15</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-028</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-028</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 28</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-028/682</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-028/683</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-028</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-028</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Because conventional optimization techniques are unable to tackle large-scale feature selection problems, meta-heuristic algorithms are widely used. In this paper, we propose a particle swarm optimization technique while utilizing regression techniques for feature selection. We then use the selected features to classify the data. Classification accuracy is used as a criterion to evaluate classifier performance, and classification is accomplished through the use of k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and Bayesian techniques. Various high dimensional data sets are used to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed approach. Results show that our approach gives better results when compared with other conventional feature selection algorithms.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-11-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-032</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-032</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 106-118</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-032/8</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-032</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This dataset is a set of files generated by Homer Legacy bringing the simulation results of hybrid energy systems over the last seven years, as a consequence of the research work led by Dr. Alexandre Beluco, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, in southern Brazil. The data correspond to twelve papers published in the last seven years. Two of them describe hydro PV hybrid systems with photovoltaic panels operating on the water surface of reservoirs. One of these twelve papers suggests the modeling of hydropower plants with reservoirs and the other the modeling of pumped hydro storage, and a third still uses these models in a place that could receive both the two types of hydroelectric power plant. The other simulated hybrid systems include wind turbines, diesel generators, batteries, among other components.

To explore the interactions between strands in a protein sheet structure, we have established an Internet-accessible relational database named SheetsPairs based on SQL Server 2000. The database has collected AAs pairs in proteins with detailed information. Furthermore, it utilizes a non-freetext database structure to store protein sequences and a specific database table with a unique number to store strands, which provides more searching options and rapid and accurate access to data queries. An IIS web server has been set up for data retrieval through a custom web interface, which enables complex data queries. Also searchable are parallel or anti-parallel folded strands and the list of strands in a specified protein.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-01</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S589</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S589</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S589-S595</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S589/463</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S589</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

A recent survey has provided a detailed comparison of various fusion methods used with Deep Web data (Li, 2013). In this paper, we propose an effective agricultural ontology-based knowledge fusion method by leveraging recent advances in data fusion, such as the semantic web and big data technologies, that will enhance the identification and fusion of new and existing data sets to make big data analytics more possible. We provide a detailed fusion method that includes agricultural ontology building, fusion rule construction, an evaluation module, etc. Empirical results show that this knowledge fusion method is useful for knowledge discovery.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-007</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-007</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 7</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-007/562</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-007/561</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-007</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-007</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper, a method based on pattern matching and machine learning (PMML) was proposed to analyze the emotional tendencies of network public opinion. Firstly, the key words in public opinion were extracted, then the patterns were extracted and matched, and the emotional tendencies of words were calculated to obtain the pattern sequence vectors. Support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to classify emotional tendencies. The Internet reviews of Meituan hotel were taken as the experimental subject. PMML method was found to have a high classification performance, with a maximum accuracy of 86.75%. It suggested the effectiveness of the proposed method. Then PMML method was used to classify the emotional tendencies of the collected reviews, and the results showed that the negative emotional tendency was greater than the positive tendency, which showed the inadequacy of Meituan hotel. The experiments in this paper provide some basis for the application of PMML in sentiment analysis of Internet public opinion.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-01-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-007</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-007</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 7</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-007/813</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-007/814</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-007/1272</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-007</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-007</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Opportunities emerge to re-visit long-standing approaches to managing data and to critically examine new capabilities. We describe the cognitive importance of metaphor. We describe several metaphors for managing, sharing, and stewarding data and examine their strengths and weaknesses. We particularly question the applicability of a “publication” approach to making data broadly available. Our preliminary conclusions are that no one metaphor satisfies enough key data system attributes and that multiple metaphors need to co-exist in support of a healthy data ecosystem. We close with proposed research questions and a call for continued discussion.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-01-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-042</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-042</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS32-WDS46</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-042/61</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-042</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This platform works as a web-DB management system in which databases can be easily managed without special skills and facilities. By defining a group manager and data manager, the proposed system defines a flexible access restriction for each user and each unit of datasets under the control of these managers. We demonstrate how a variety of web-DBs are appropriately integrated under one management system in such situations in which each web-DB has a different user interface in its search and data distribution functions and is designed with a different language (or script) and connection method to its DB. In spite of the diversity of web-DBs, the proposed system is highly suitable for practical use.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2010-01-13</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.SS_IGY-008</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.SS_IGY-008</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009): Special Issue; PIGY32-IGY43</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.SS_IGY-008/276</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.SS_IGY-008</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It is necessary for the system to control the interaction among the concurrent transactions. This paper presents a new locking model for concurrency control in object oriented database systems. This model is motivated by a desire to provide high concurrency and low locking overheads in accessing objects. The proposed model consists of a rich set of lock modes, hash table, lock-based signatures and B+ trees. The performance study result shows that the proposed model performs well for all possible operations on objects.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.59</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.4.59</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 4 (2005); 59-66</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.59/359</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.4.59</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Today, there are tens of satellites orbiting the Earth and collecting frequent global observations for the benefit of mankind. Collaboration between NASA and organizations in the US and other countries has been extremely important in maintaining the Earth observation capabilities as well as collecting, organizing and managing the data. These collaborations have occurred in the form of: 1. NASA’s developing and launching spacecraft and instruments for operation by other agencies; 2. Instruments from collaborating organizations being flown on NASA satellites; and 3. Instruments from NASA being flown on satellites from collaborating organizations. In addition, there are collaborations such as joint science teams, data exchanges, and participation in international organizations to promote interoperability of various data systems. The purpose of this paper is to describe some of the Earth science data-related collaborative efforts in which NASA participates, and highlight a few results relevant to Earth system science research obtained through such collaborations.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-11-13</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-051</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-051</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 51</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-051/729</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-051/730</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-051/320</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-051</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-051</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Global</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">1990-present</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">N/A</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

DSA assessment helped ICPSR become more transparent, monitor and improve archival processes and procedures, and raise awareness within the organization and beyond about best practices for repositories.

An offshoot and collaborator of the Perseus Digital Library (PDL), Perseids is also an experiment in reusing and extending existing infrastructure, tools, and services. This paper discusses infrastructure in the domain of digital humanities (DH). It outlines some general approaches to facilitating data sharing in this domain, and the specific choices we made in developing Perseids to serve that goal. It concludes by identifying lessons we have learned about sustainability in the process of building Perseids, noting some critical gaps in infrastructure for the digital humanities, and suggesting some implications for the wider community.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-18</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-019</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-019</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 19</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-019/663</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-019/664</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/394</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/395</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/396</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/397</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/398</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/399</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/400</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/401</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/402</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/403</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/404</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-019/405</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-019</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-019</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Replication is widely applied to improve the scalability and availability of data. With full replication, database systems cannot scale well, since all updates must be replicated to all nodes, whether or not they are needed there. With virtual Full Replication, all nodes have an image of a fully replicated database and the system manages the knowledge of what is needed for each node to adapt to the actual needs, so that the system can be more scalable. This work proposes a scalable and consistent replication protocol using an adaptive clustering technique that dynamically detects the new data requirements. Because time is critical in such systems, the clustering technique must take into account both the communication time cost and the timing properties of the data. The proposed protocol also proposes a new updated method for addressing the temporal inconsistency problem by skipping unnecessary operations. It allows many database nodes to update their data concurrently, without any need for distributed synchronization. It uses state-transfer propagation with on-demand integration techniques to reduce the temporal inconsistency. The experimental results show the ability of the proposed protocol to reduce the system resources consumed and improves system scalability while maintaining consistency.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-03-17</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-004</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 4</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/Array</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-004/590</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-004/591</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-004/23</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-004/24</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-004/25</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-004/26</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-004/27</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2016-004/28</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess</dc:rights><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

But as the prevalence of policies increases, there is potential to confuse researchers and support staff with numerous or conflicting policy requirements. We define and describe 14 features of journal research data policies and arrange these into a set of six standard policy types or tiers, which can be adopted by journals and publishers to promote data sharing in a way that encourages good practice and is appropriate for their audience’s perceived needs. Policy features include coverage of topics such as data citation, data repositories, data availability statements, data standards and formats, and peer review of research data. These policy features and types have been created by reviewing the policies of multiple scholarly publishers, which collectively publish more than 10,000 journals, and through discussions and consensus building with multiple stakeholders in research data policy via the Data Policy Standardisation and Implementation Interest Group of the Research Data Alliance. Implementation guidelines for the standard research data policies for journals and publishers are also provided, along with template policy texts which can be implemented by journals in their Information for Authors and publishing workflows. We conclude with a call for collaboration across the scholarly publishing and wider research community to drive further implementation and adoption of consistent research data policies. Publisher's Note: a correction article relating to this publication has been published and can be found at http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-017</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-02-21</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-005</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-005</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 5</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-005/933</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-005/934</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-005/1974</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-005</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-005</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has outlined the importance of information for improving health for all. However, financial resources remain limited. Health costs represent 11% of GNP in France, Germany, Switzerland and Canada, 14% in the USA, and 7.5% in Spain and the United Kingdom. Governments, local powers, health or insurance organizations therefore face difficult choices in terms of opportunities and priorities, and for that they need specific and valuable data. Firstly, this paper provide a comprehensive overview of our networked society and the appointment of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) and Health (in other words e-Health) in a perspective of needs and uses at the micro, meso, and macro levels. We point out the main challenges of development of Nationwide Health Information Network both in the US, UK and France. Then we analyze the main issues about data for Decision Making in Networked Health: coordination and evaluation. In the last sections, we use an Information System perspective to investigate the three interoperability layers (micro, meso and macro). We analyze the requirements and challenges to design an interoperability global architecture which supports different kinds of interactions; then we focus on the harmonization efforts provided at several levels. Finally, we identify common methodological and engineering issues.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-06-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.64</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.64</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 64-78</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.64/454</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.64</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The key part of this paper deals with a description of the design and implementation of a pilot system that should serve for digital archiving of scientific information of certain kind – MSc and PhD theses at Czech Technical University in Prague. One of the reasons for archiving of this type of information was the fact that these theses contain information about scientific and technological developments in a given period of time. Such information might be widely appreciated in future by historians who will investigate the history of science and technology of a certain period of time. The research is oriented towards robust archiving systems that can be used in small-scale applications. These small systems do not offer universal solutions in the field of digital archiving – they solve problems that become urgent in various applications: to save current digital documents in the form that could be transferable to general archiving systems developed later. The described implementation is a pilot practical solution to this problem. The approach described in the paper will allow the user to archive also documents that contain non-textual information.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-25</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.237</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.4.237</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 4 (2005); 237-243</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.237/535</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.4.237</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

There are as many arguments about how datasets are like cakes1 as there are about how datasets aren’t like cakes.2It can be easy to categorise a dataset as being a special class of academic paper. Positively, this means that the tools and services for scholarly publication can be utilised to transmit and verify datasets, improving visibility, reproducibility, and attribution for the dataset creators. Negatively, if a dataset doesn’t fit within the criteria to meet the “academic publication” mould (e.g. because it is being continually versioned and updated, or it is still being collected and will be for decades) it might be considered to be of less value to the community.It is often said that “all models are wrong, but some are useful” (Box, 1979). Hence we need to determine the usefulness and limits of models and metaphors, especially when trying to develop new processes and systems. This paper further develops the metaphors outlined in Parsons and Fox (2013), and gives real world examples of the metaphors from scientific data stored in the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) – a discipline-specific environmental data repository, and the processes that created the datasets.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-08-14</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-039</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-039</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 39</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-039/878</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-039/879</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-039</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-039</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

With research data, data policy should also serve the broader goals of advancing scientific and scholarly inquiry and society at large. This is especially true with government-funded data, which likely comprise the vast majority of research data. Data policy should address multiple issues, depending on the nature and objectives of the data. These issues include data access requirements, data preservation and stewardship requirements, standards and compliance mechanisms, data security issues, privacy and ethical concerns, and potentially even specific collection protocols and defined data flows. The specifics of different policies can vary dramatically, but all data policies need to address data access and preservation. Research data gain value with use and must therefore be accessible and preserved for future access. This article focuses on data access. While policy might address multiple issues, at a first level it must address where the data stand on what Lyon (2009) calls the continuum of openness. Making data as openly accessible as possible provides the greatest societal benefit, and a central purpose of data policy is to work toward ethically open data access. An open data regime not only maximizes the benefit of the data, it also simplifies most of the other issues around effective research data stewardship and infrastructure development.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-07-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-008</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-008</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; GRDI43-GRDI50</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.GRDI-008/224</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.GRDI-008</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It is called AGROWIT. Although the authors used previous Technology Acceptance Model user acceptance research as a basis for investigation of user acceptance of AGROWIT, the model had to be extended and constructs from the Triandis model that were added increased the predictive results of the TAM, but only slightly. Relationships among primary TAM constructs used are in substantive agreement with those characteristic of previous TAM research. Significant positive relationships between perceived usefulness, ease of use, and system usage were consistent with previous TAM research. The observed mediating role of perceived usefulness in the relationship between ease of use and usage was also in consonance with earlier findings. The findings are significant because they suggest that the considerable body of previous TAM-related information technology research may be usefully applied to the knowledge management domain to promote further investigation of factors affecting the acceptance and usage of knowledge management information systems such as AGROWIT by farmers, extension workers, and agriculture researchers.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2008-04-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.31</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.7.31</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 7 (2008); 31-45</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.31/309</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.7.31</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Data technology is accelerating the quality and effectiveness of its research, and the rate of astronomical discovery is higher than ever. As a result, many view astronomy as being in a \"Golden Age,\" and projects such as the Virtual Observatory are amongst the most ambitious data projects in any field of science. But these powerful tools will be impotent unless the data on which they operate are of matching quality. Astronomy, like other fields of science, therefore needs to establish and agree on a set of guiding principles for the management of astronomical data. To focus this process, we are constructing a \"data manifesto,\" which proposes guidelines to maximise the rate and cost-effectiveness of scientific discovery.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S116</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S116</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S116-S124</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S116/391</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S116</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Even assuming that human errors and technical faults will never happen, repositories can be subject to hacking attacks. Therefore, repositories accepting personal/sensitive data (or other forms of restricted data) should have workflows in place with defined procedures to be followed should things go wrong and restricted data is inappropriately released. In this paper we will report on our considerations and procedures when restricted data from our institution was inappropriately released.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-03-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-010</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-010</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 10</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-010/642</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-010/643</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-010</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-010</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">United Kingdom</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This paper describes a curation tool that responds to this challenge by economizing and optimizing curation efforts. The curation tool is implemented at Yale University’s Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS) as YARD. By standardizing the curation workflow, YARD helps create high quality data packages that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) and promotes research transparency by connecting the activities of researchers, curators, and publishers through a single pipeline.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2020-07-15</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-028</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2020-028</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 19 (2020); 28</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-028/980</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2020-028/981</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2114</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2115</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2116</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2117</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2118</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2209</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2210</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2211</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2212</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2213</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2214</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2020-028/2215</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-028</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2020-028</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

That incident was associated with the so-called \"black foot disease.\" In the late 1970s and early 1980s, arsenic specific coetaneous changes were diagnosed in the Xinjiang Autonomous Rregion and subsequently in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shanxi Province. Recently, endemic arsenicosis was also found in Jilin, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Anhui Provinces. The prevalence of arsenicosis in China is becoming more and more serious. In order to prevent and control it, many departments and institutes have begun to work in this field. They have made a great progress including also the sharing of arsenicosis data within a limited area. But the limited nature of this data sharing is a barrier for preventing and controlling arsenicosis. Only once data sharing is realized within the whole nation, can we discover the best way of eliminating arsenicosis. With this goal in mind, we have set up a rudimentary platform of asenicosis data sharing. This gradually needs to be improved and improved.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-09-06</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S511</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S511</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S511-S517</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S511/445</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S511</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The comparison between different data sets and different disciplines creates new data, adds value, and finally accumulates knowledge. Also the distribution and accessibility of research results is an important factor for international work. The gas hydrate research community is dispersed across the globe and therefore, a common technical communication language or format is strongly demanded. The CODATA Gas Hydrate Data Task Group is creating the Gas Hydrate Markup Language (GHML), a standard based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) to enable the transport, modeling, and storage of all manner of objects related to gas hydrate research. GHML initially offers an easily deducible content because of the text-based encoding of information, which does not use binary data. The result of these investigations is a custom-designed application schema, which describes the features, elements, and their properties, defining all aspects of Gas Hydrates.One of the components of GHML is the \"Field Data\" module, which is used for all data and information coming from the field. It considers international standards, particularly the standards defined by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) and the OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium). Various related standards were analyzed and compared with our requirements (in particular the Geographic Markup Language (ISO19136, GML) and the whole ISO19000 series). However, the requirements demanded a quick solution and an XML application schema readable for any scientist without a background in information technology. Therefore, ideas, concepts and definitions have been used to build up the modules of GHML without importing any of these Markup languages. This enables a comprehensive schema and simple use.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-06-29</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.GH6</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.GH6</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007): Special Issue; GH6-GH17</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.GH6/526</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.GH6</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

NIST is a non-regulatory agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce with a mission to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST research results in the production and distribution of standard reference materials, calibration services, and datasets. These are generated from a wide range of complex laboratory instrumentation, expert analyses, and calibration processes. In response to a government open data policy, and in collaboration with the broader research community, NIST has developed a federated Open Access to Research (OAR) scientific data infrastructure aligned with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles. Through the OAR initiatives, NIST’s Material Measurement Laboratory Office of Data and Informatics (ODI) recently released a new scientific data discovery portal and public data repository. These science-oriented applications provide dissemination and public access for data from across the broad spectrum of NIST research disciplines, including chemistry, biology, materials science (such as crystallography, nanomaterials, etc.), physics, disaster resilience, cyberinfrastructure, communications, forensics, and others. NIST’s public data consist of carefully curated Standard Reference Data, legacy high valued data, and new research data publications. The repository is thus evolving both in content and features as the nature of research progresses. Implementation of the OAR infrastructure is key to NIST’s role in sharing high integrity reproducible research for measurement science in a rapidly changing world.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-07-08</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-030</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-030</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 30</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-030/861</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-030/862</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-030/1453</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-030/1454</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-030/1455</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-030/1456</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-030/1457</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-030</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-030</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

It is therefore necessary to make decisions regarding what can be preserved and why it should be preserved. This paper reviews the processes used by two data archives, one from the United States and one from the United Kingdom, to illustrate how data are selected for archiving, how they are appraised, and what steps are required to retain the usefulness of the data for future use. It also presents new initiatives that seek to encourage an increase in the long-term preservation of digital resources.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.209</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.3.209</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 3 (2004): Special Issue; 209-221</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.3.209/302</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.3.209</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Using weights and properties generated by entropy concepts, including the idea of information entropy, the comprehensive weight, which can be combined with entropy weight, is calculated. A grey evaluation model of a project risk evaluation index based on comprehensive entropy weight is built. Further, we present empirical research on a real project, which indicates that this approach calculates easily, gives weight scientifically, and provides evaluation accurately.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-03-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.171</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.7.171</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 7 (2008); 171-178</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.7.171/334</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.7.171</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This discovery has transformed traditional statistical modeling methods as well as improved consistency for model applicability. The individuals' different characteristics during the evolution of generations, which are randomly changeable, are treated as Markov random processes. This paper also proposes that a GP algorithm with \"optimal individuals reserved strategy\" is the best solution to this problem, and therefore the adaptive individuals finally will be evolved. This will allow practical applications in software reliability modeling analysis and forecasting for failure behaviors. Moreover it can verify the feasibility and availability of the GP algorithm, which is applied to software failure data series forecasting on a theoretical basis. The results show that the GP algorithm is the best solution for software failure behaviors in a variety of disciplines.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-05-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S310</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S310</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S310-S316</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S310/415</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S310</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The data tiers consist of several distributive data servers that are located in each CAS institute and support such unstructured data formats as vector files, remote sensing images or other raster files, documents, multi-media files, tables, and other format files. For the spatial data files, format transformation service is provided. The middle tier involves a centralized metadata server, which stores metadata records of data on all data servers. The primary function of this tier is catalog service, supporting the creation, search, browsing, updating, and deletion of catalogs. The client tier involves an integrated client that provides the end-users interfaces to search, browse, and download data or create a catalog and upload data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-10-26</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S770</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S770</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S770-S778</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S770/496</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S770</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

A universal public domain for scientific data and information will be transformative for both science and society. Over the last several years, two ad-hoc ICSU committees, the Strategic Committee on Information and Data (SCID) and the Strategic Coordinating Committee on Information and Data (SCCID), produced key reports that make 5 and 14 recommendations respectively aimed at improving universal and equitable access to data and information for science and providing direction for key international scientific bodies, such as the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) as well as a newly ratified (by ICSU in 2008) formation of the World Data System. This contribution outlines the framing context for both committees based on the changed world scene for scientific data conduct in the 21st century. We include details on the relevant recommendations and important consequences for the worldwide community of data providers and consumers, ultimately leading to a conclusion, and avenues for advancement that must be carried to the many thousands of data scientists world-wide.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-01-19</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-001</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-001</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS1-WDS12</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-001/53</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-001</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The results obtained in the 10-km Chernobyl zone demonstrated a decrease in plant disease resistance and appearance of a \"new\" population of stem rust agents of cereal with a high frequency of more virulent clones. Radionuclide contamination and heavy metals lead to wider virus spread and a higher diversity of virus species. The Chernobyl zone is a territory of enhanced risk and potential threats for the environment. A special type of monitoring of microevolution processes in plant pathogens should provide better understanding of how serious these potential threats are.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-06-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.BR-07</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.BR-07</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009): Special Issue; PBR49-BR66</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.BR-07/269</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.BR-07</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

They thus serve a variety of scientific disciplines, but are all driven by considerations of accuracy, precise characterization, and potential for search, analysis and reuse. They also serve a variety of end-users in academia and industry, and have evolved through different funding and licensing models. The diversity of their operational mechanisms combined with their undisputed value as scientific research tools gives rise to a rich ecosystem. A session at SciDataCon2016 gave an overview of the largest extant crystallographic databases and their current activities and plans for the future. This review summarizes these presentations and considers them alongside other players in the field, demonstrating their variety, versatility and focus on quality and usefulness.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-08-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-038</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-038</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 38</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-038/703</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-038/704</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-038/259</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-038/260</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-038</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-038</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Worldwide</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

But it is also the most likely to generate bubble economy, causing financial risks; it will trigger a series of social contradictions and cause social unrest in severe cases. Therefore, it is urgent to improve and optimize the real estate evaluation model. In this study, the real estate was evaluated based on the neural network model optimized by genetic algorithm. Through sorting out and summarizing the real estate data in a period of time, the corresponding model was established and the test data were obtained. The average relative error value of the genetic algorithm optimized neural network model was 3.552, which was smaller than that of the Back-Propagation (BP) neural network prediction model. The experimental conclusion that the new network model was better than the traditional model was obtained. This work opens up a new route of real estate evaluation.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-07-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-036</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-036</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 36</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-036/872</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-036/873</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-036/1586</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-036/1587</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-036/1588</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-036/1589</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-036/1590</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-036</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-036</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

For practical purposes, we estimate the risk of low dose radiation by extrapolating the effects at high doses to low doses in a linear relationship. However, several lines of evidence have accumulated in recent years that suggest this linear extrapolation is not necessarily correct and needs further scientific evaluation. Today, many scientists in the field are striving to understand the biological responses to low dose radiation. This work will provide new and perhaps convincing data which are necessary for risk estimation of low dose radiation. Here, I overview the background of the issue.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-03-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S99</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S99</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S99-S103</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S99/389</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S99</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper we propose an enhanced hashing technique that uses a hash table combined with a binary tree, searching on the binary representation of a portion the primary key of records that is associated with each index of the hash table. The paper contains numerous examples to describe the technique. The technique shows significant improvements in searching, insertion, and deletion for systems with huge amounts of data. The paper also presents the mathematical analysis of the proposed technique and comparative results.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-11-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.143</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.5.143</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 5 (2006); 143-161</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.5.143/470</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.5.143</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this paper, waiting time, crowded time, and driving time between different bus stations on different bus routes at different times of the day are calculated from bus IC cards data history. Then, a multi-objective program with various constraints is suggested to recommend comfortable bus routes for bus passengers, and a genetic algorithm is developed to search for expected solutions. The proposed method is implemented using bus IC cards data from Chongqing, China and will be a promising tool for bus passengers when choosing comfortable bus routes.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-05-22</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-014</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2015-014</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 14 (2015); 14</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-014/557</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2015-014/558</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-014</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2015-014</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Manifold conflicting and shifting values need to be reconciled in pursuing viable data-management policies. For example, how does one make data available in useable form to stakeholders including scientists, governments and businesses worldwide, while assuring confidentiality, satisfying one's research ethics committee, protecting intellectual property and national security, and containing costs? Increasingly, ethical problem solving requires integration of ethics with technological \"know how\" and empirical research on the presenting problem. Each problem is highly contextual; broad application of general ethical principles such as always practice openness, or prepare all data for sharing, may have harmful unintended consequences. Chaos theory provides a heuristic or vision for understanding and coping with complexity and uncertainty. It does not provide answers to problems of data management, but frames the issues, and provides appropriate expectations and heuristics for considering data management problems.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2006-01-05</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.165</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.4.165</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 4 (2005); 165-170</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.4.165/438</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.4.165</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Sinology Database is in several different languages and should satisfy the differing needs of data collection and database application. The data quality is strictly controlled during the whole data life cycle, which includes data collection, processing, storage, and accessing. In addition, according to the standards and specifications of the metadata, metadata are created to accompany the data, which satisfies the cooperation among different databases. Finally, besides the function of searching, statistical calculation, and sorting, the database is also used for data mining and knowledge discovery.

Nonetheless, economic growth is uneven among African countries, and many obstacles must be overcome in order to realize the full potential of opportunity. To achieve long-term sustainable investment results, and ultimately progress towards Sustainable Development goals, many risks must be isolated, analyzed, and mitigated. This paper introduces the concept of Sustainability Risk, identifying a set of major risk components for Sub-Saharan Africa and building an integral measure to quantify the degree of remoteness of the forty-six Sub-Saharan Africa countries from the total set of threats considered. The countries are separated into distinct groups with similar characteristics in terms of Sustainability Risk, and an analysis for potential decision-making, based on the visualization of the countries' position in relation to the major sustainability threats, is performed for each group. The research identifies risks with maximum impacts.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2011-11-27</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.10-018</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.10-018</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 10 (2011); 24-41</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.10-018/72</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.10-018</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

At a minimum, the data are needed for change analysis. Likewise, most people would value efforts to ensure the preservation of the archived S&amp;amp;T data. Future generations will use analysis techniques not even considered today. Until recently, archiving and preserving these data were usually accomplished within existing infrastructures and budgets. As the volume of archived data increases, however, organizations charged with archiving S&amp;amp;T data will be increasingly challenged (U.S. General Accounting Office, 2002). The U.S. Geological Survey has had experience in this area and has developed strategies to deal with the mountain of land remote sensing data currently being managed and the tidal wave of expected new data. The Agency has dealt with archiving issues, such as selection criteria, purging, advisory panels, and data access, and has met with preservation challenges involving photographic and digital media. That experience has allowed the USGS to develop management approaches, which this paper outlines.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2003-10-31</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.159</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.2.159</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 2 (2003); 159-163</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.2.159/208</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.2.159</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, these resources have a wide variety of formats, terminologies, and concepts, which makes it difficult to find appropriate information for materials design, development, and evaluation. One solution to this problem is to integrate these resources into a computer readable concept map, called a domain ontology, which describes concepts and relationships among the concepts in materials science and engineering. This paper describes a trial that constructs a standard of metadata description using ontology language and demonstrates the validity of this construction through data exchange among heterogeneous material databases. \"Materials Ontology,\" which consists of several sub ontologies corresponding to substance, process, environment, and property, is developed using the ontology language of the Semantic Web, OWL, which enables the definition of a flexible and detailed structure of materials information. A versatile \"materials data format\" is built on the Materials Ontology as a component of the materials information platform and is applied to exchange data among three different thermal property databases, maintained by two major materials science research institutes in Japan.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2010-06-26</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.008-041</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.008-041</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 9 (2010); 54-61</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.008-041/125</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.008-041</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We consider the case of Mozambique, a country characterised by low income and low administrative capacity, but also by a policy environment that has turned a focused lens on public funding to agriculture. We explore the extent to which domestic analysts may be able to access and use such data to reliably quantify public resource allocation to the sector, and to unpack the ‘black box’ of what goes into country-level public expenditure statistics. We find that data are, surprisingly, freely available in great abundance. This has encouraging aspects but also pitfalls: On the one hand, data that are often out of public sight are openly accessible for Mozambican researchers to draw upon. But the drawback of high abundance emanates from its manifestation in the form of a proliferation of multiple classification systems used to create a fine disaggregation of public funds data; given Mozambique’s limited public sector capacity, this has meant that each classification system leaves a lot to be desired, making it hard to use any single one to accurately and fully reliably reconstruct the amount of public resources going to agriculture. Making the hard choice to eliminate some of the classification systems, and dedicate this freed-up capacity to be more thorough on the retained ones, would better serve domestic users of such data, as well as the government, which is both a consumer and producer of these data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-04-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-009</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-009</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 9</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-009/749</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-009/750</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-009/681</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-009/956</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-009</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-009</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Mozambique</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">various</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

However, previous related studies on this field narrowed their research scopes into information type and information specification. This paper focuses on the verification and the tracing of information using an information dissemination platform and other Semantic Web-based services. Services on our platform include information dissemination services to support reliable information exchange among researchers and knowledge service to provide unrevealed information. The latter is also divided into the two: knowledgization using ontology and inference using a Semantic Web-based inference engine. This paper discusses how this platform supports instant knowledge addition and inference. We demonstrate our approach by constructing an ontology for national R&amp;amp;D reference information using 37,656 RDF triples from about 2,300 KISTI (Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information) outcomes. Three knowledge services including 'Communities of Practice', 'Researcher Tracing,' and 'Research Map' were implemented on our platform using a Jena framework. Our study shows that information dissemination platforms will make a meaningful contribution to the possibility of realizing a practical Semantic Web-based information dissemination platform.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-05-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S241</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S241</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); S241-S249</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S241/406</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S241</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

To avoid the reoccurrence of similar failures, materials failure analysis is executed to investigate the reasons for the failure and to propose improved strategies. The whole procedure needs sufficient domain knowledge and also produces valuable new knowledge. However, the information about the materials failure analysis is usually retained by the domain expert, and its sharing is technically difficult. This phenomenon may seriously reduce the efficiency and decrease the veracity of the failure analysis. To solve this problem, this paper adopts ontology, a novel technology from the Semantic Web, as a tool for knowledge representation and sharing and describes the construction of the ontology to obtain information concerning the failure analysis, application area, materials, and failure cases. The ontology represented information is machine-understandable and can be easily shared through the Internet. At the same time, failure case intelligent retrieval, advanced statistics, and even automatic reasoning can be accomplished based on ontology represented knowledge. Obviously this can promote the knowledge sharing of materials service safety and improve the efficiency of failure analysis. The case of a nuclear power plant area is presented to show the details and benefits of this method.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-01-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12-047</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.12-047</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013); 181-190</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12-047/45</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.12-047</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Research data is one of the important science data resources, but it is difficult to be archived and shared. To develop a long term data integration and sharing mechanism, a new approach to data archiving of research data derived from science research projects has been developed in China. In 2008, the host agency of the World Data Center for Renewable Resources and Environment, authorized by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, began to implement the first pilot experiment for research data archiving. The approach’s data archiving process includes four phases: data plan development, data archiving preparation, data submission, and data sharing and management. In order to make data archiving operate more smoothly, a data archiving environment was established. This includes a uniform core metadata standard, data archiving specifications, a smart metadata register tool, and a web-based data management and sharing platform. During the last 3 years, research data from 49 projects has been collected by the sharing center. The datasets are about 2.26 TB in total size and have attracted over 100 users.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-02-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-020</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj.WDS-020</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS120-WDS123</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-020/94</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj.WDS-020</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In this case study I have examined openness strategies, practices and attitudes in two open collaboration research projects created by Finnish researchers, in order to understand what made them resistant to the fear of scooping. The radically open approach of the projects includes open by default funding proposals, co-authorship and community membership. Primary sources used are interviews of the projects’ founding members. The analysis indicates that openness requires trust in close peers, but not necessarily in research community or society at large. Based on the case study evidence, focusing on intrinsic goals, like new knowledge and bringing about ethical reform, instead of external goals such as publications, supports openness. Understanding fundaments of science, philosophy of science and research ethics, can also have a beneficial effect on willingness to share. Whether there are aspects in open sharing that makes it seem riskier from the point of view of certain demographical groups within research community, such as women, could be worth closer inspection.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-06-15</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-029</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-029</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 29</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-029/684</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-029/685</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-029/365</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-029</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-029</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Previous studies have identified legal impediments to open access arising from intellectual property, confidentiality, privacy, national security, patent and tort laws. The legal impediments have not been fully addressed by public research funding agencies in Malaysia, thus the need for a model guidelines to be developed. This study conducted a comparative analysis of the  principles/policies/guidelines on open access to research data of the civil society, government bodies, research funding agencies and research institutions in Australia, Canada, the EU, the UK and the USA. This comparative analysis attempts to identify the appropriate measures to address the legal impediments to open access to research data. This model guidelines is of international standard and suitable for adoption by public research funding agencies and research institutions in Malaysia. Hence, the model guidelines can become a benchmark in pursuing the objective of enabling open access to publicly funded research data in Malaysia.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-06-28</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-027</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-027</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 27</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-027/853</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-027/854</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-027</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-027</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Initially, it integrated data from hydrographic profiles obtained from CTDs (conductivity, temperature, depth) equipped with several sensors, but it has been recently extended to incorporate data obtained with hydrocasts using oceanographic Niskin or Nansen bottles. The result is an extensive regional resource database that includies physical hydrographic data such as temperature (T), salinity (S), dissolved oxygen (DO), fluorescence, and turbidity, as well as biochemical data, specifically dissolved inorganic nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, and silicate) and chlorophyll-a. Different technologies and methodologies were used by independent teams during the four decades of data sampling. However in the IBAMar database, data have been reprocessed using the same protocols and a standard quality control (QC) methodology has been applied to each variable. The result is a homogeneous and quality-controlled data. IBAMar database at standard levels is freely available for exploration and download from http://www.ba.ieo.es/ibamar/.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2015-01-10</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-020</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-020</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 172-191</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-020/13</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-020</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

This paper proposes new methods to identify those persons for the first time from their victory sign. These methods are based on features extracted from the fingers areas using shape moments in addition to other features related to fingers contours. To evaluate the proposed methods and to show the feasibility of this study we have created a victory sign database for 400 volunteers using a mobile phone camera. The experimental results using different classifiers show encouraging identification results; as the best precision/recall were achieved by merging normalized features from both methods using linear discriminate analysis classifier with 96.6% precision and 96.3 recall. Such a high performance achieved by the proposed methods shows their great potential to be applied for terrorists’ identification from their victory sign.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2018-10-15</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-027</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2018-027</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 17 (2018); 27</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-027/785</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2018-027/786</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1007</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1008</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1009</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1010</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1011</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1012</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1013</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1014</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1015</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1016</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1017</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1018</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2018-027/1224</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-027</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2018-027</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

Special attention was paid to the structural behavior of SrZrO3 and the decomposition of K3TbBr6 at low temperature, respectively, to illustrate how to select an appropriate thermodynamic model based on crystal structure and chemistry information, how to identify and resolve the inconsistency between various kinds of experimental data, and how to use thermodynamic modeling as a basic tool in the development and optimization of materials and process. In the present work, different structures of SrZrO3 were explained by thermodynamic calculation and confirmed with experimental technologies. The decomposition of the compound K3TbBr6at about 593 K was detected by the present thermodynamic calculation and the new complementary experimental measurements. Comparison between the calculated and measured phase diagrams as well as thermodynamic quantities provided the final test of the overall consistency between the reliable experimental information and the present modeling and thermodynamic computation.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2007-08-07</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S420</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.6.S420</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 6 (2007); dsj.6.S408</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.6.S420/429</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.6.S420</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The data was collected in an efficient and systematic way by long-term experiments and observations of black land and statistics information. It is based on the ORACLE database management system and the interface is written in PB language. The database has the following main facilities:(1) runs on Windows platforms; (2) facilitates data entry from *.dbf to ORACLE or creates ORACLE tables directly; (3)has a metadata facility that describes the methods used in the laboratory or in the observations; (4) data can be transferred to an expert system for simulation analysis and estimates made by Visual C++ and Visual Basic; (5) can be connected with GIS, so it is easy to analyze changes in land use ; and (6) allows metadata and data entity to be shared on the internet. The following datasets are included in CSDB_BL: long-term experiments and observations of water, soil, climate, biology, special research projects, and a natural resource survey of Hailun County in the 1980s; images from remote sensing, graphs of vectors and grids, and statistics from Northeast of China. CSDB_BL can be used in the research and evaluation of agricultural sustainability nationally, regionally, or locally. Also, it can be used as a tool to assist the government in planning for agricultural development.

Several recent reports have discussed the issues around \"lost\" data sets: those which are intended to be shared but cannot be identified and utilized effectively because of insufficient associated metadata. Both problems are approaching critical levels in Canada and internationally, a situation that is unacceptable because these data sets are often generated as a result of public funding. Solutions may involve providing support and training for researchers on how they can best collect and manage their data sets or developing gateways to scientific data sets. NRC-CISTI is the largest comprehensive source of scientific, technical, and medical information in North America, with a mandate to serve as Canada's national science library. Through its publishing arm, NRC Research Press, it is also Canada's foremost scientific publisher. NRC-CISTI is an organization with demonstrated expertise in metadata management, which, until recently, focused primarily on library and publishing contexts. However in November 2007, it formally committed to expand its agenda to address the management of scientific research data and the related critical needs of the research community. This paper presents NRC-CISTI's activities in this area. NRC-CISTI has begun by hosting forums in which the critical players (including the granting agencies) mapped out targets and approaches. It has strengthened its own internal expertise regarding metadata and management of scientific data sets. Finally, NRC-CISTI is developing a gateway Web site which will provide access to Canadian scientific data sets and related metadata, tools, educational resources, and other informative and collaborative tools urgently needed by Canadian and international researchers. NRC-CISTI is the sponsoring body for the Canadian National Committee for CODATA and is committed to promoting and supporting CNC/CODATA's initiatives.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-03-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.27</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.8.27</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 27-33</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.8.27/199</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.8.27</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

They were invented to address the problem of disappearing internet links, also known as “link rot”, which was seen as undermining the emerging digital record of science. A number of PID systems have since been developed, and their utility for the management of the scientific record has been reviewed. Since the initial launch of the Handle System, we have seen many more uses for persistent identification, besides literature and data. A session at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly 2016 was dedicated to ‘20 years of persistent identifiers – where do we go next?’ A number of contributions from this session have since been developed into full papers that form this Data Science Journal Special Collection, with additional solicited contributions. Together, these papers give us an overview of the use of persistent identifiers in research information infrastructures and possible future directions.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-12-11</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-052</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-052</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 52</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-052/731</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-052/732</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-052</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-052</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

A large number of research groups and communities are building and developing data-driven workflows. However, much of the data and knowledge is stored in different heterogeneous data sources maintained by different groups. This leads to a reduced availability of the data and poor interoperability between systems in this domain. Ontology-based techniques are an important way to reduce these problems and a number of efforts have started. In this paper we investigate efforts in the materials science, and in particular in the nanotechnology domain, and show how such ontologies developed by domain experts, can be improved. We use a phrase-based topic model approach and formal topical concept analysis on unstructured text in this domain to suggest additional concepts and axioms for the ontology that should be validated by a domain expert. We describe the techniques and show the usefulness of the approach through an experiment where we extend two nanotechnology ontologies using approximately 600 titles and abstracts.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-10-03</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-050</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-050</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 50</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-050/900</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-050/901</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1772</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1773</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1774</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1775</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1776</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1777</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-050/1885</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-050</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-050</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The 6th Extremely Large Databases workshop was convened alongside the XLDB conference to discuss the challenges in the health care, biology, and natural resources communities. The role of cloud computing, the dominance of file-based solutions in science applications, in-situ and predictive analysis, and commercial software use in academic environments were discussed in depth as well. This paper summarizes the discussions of this workshop.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-05-08</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12_023</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.12_023</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013); 23-32</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.12_023/36</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.12_023</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

We propose an algorithm for determining optimal patterns in data by separately training and testing three decision tree models in the Pima Indians Diabetes and the Bupa Liver Disorders datasets. Model performance is assessed using ROC curves and the Youden Index. Moving differences between sequential fitted parameters are then extracted, and their respective probability density estimations are used to track their variability using an iterative graphical data visualisation technique developed for this purpose. Our results show that the proposed strategy separates the groups more robustly than the plain ROC/Youden approach, eliminates obscurity, and minimizes over-fitting. Further, the algorithm can easily be understood by non-specialists and demonstrates multi-disciplinary compliance.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-05-02</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-045</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-045</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS247-WDS253</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-045/166</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-045</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The principal data source is the MAGDAS (MAGnetic Data Acquisition System) project, which is a global network of geomagnetic observations operated by collaborations between ICSWSE and institutions in many countries. We operate 66 stations including more than 30 stations distributed along the 210o magnetic meridian and more than 10 stations along the magnetic equator. We have established a semi-automatic data acquisition system via the Internet. Provisional data plots and geomagnetic indices derived from the project are available to the scientific community.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2013-02-24</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-014</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.WDS-014</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 12 (2013): Special Issue; WDS92-WDS96</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.WDS-014/85</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.WDS-014</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The simple but comprehensive user interface of the system permits the entering of uncertain specifications in query forms. The system was modelled and simulated in a Matlab environment; its implementation was carried out using Borland C++ Builder. The result of the performance measure of the system using precision and recall rates is encouraging. Similarly, the smaller amount of more precise information retrieved by the system will positively impact the response time perceived by the users.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2009-09-30</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-038</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.007-038</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 8 (2009); 233-242</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.007-038/250</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.007-038</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

In support of this integrated High Performance Computing/High Performance Data (HPC/HPD) infrastructure, NCI’s data management practices includes building catalogues, DOI minting, data curation, data publishing, and data delivery through a variety of data services. The metadata catalogues, DOIs, THREDDS, and Vocabularies, all use different Uniform Resource Locator (URL) styles. A Persistent IDentifier (PID) service provides an important utility to manage URLs in a consistent, controlled and monitored manner to support the robustness of our national ‘Big Data’ infrastructure. In this paper we demonstrate NCI’s approach of utilising the NCI’s PID Service to consistently manage its persistent identifiers with various applications. </dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2017-04-18</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-020</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2017-020</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 16 (2017); 20</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-020/665</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2017-020/666</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-020/303</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-020/304</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-020/305</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-020/306</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-020/307</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2017-020/308</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-020</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2017-020</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

These two forests were classified respectively by Decision No. 766-54/EF and No. 765-54/EF signed on July, 29th 1954 by the colonial authority. To date, there is still no legislative enactment that establishes Djamde’s reserve status. Since 2003, its management has been granted to TOGO-FAUNE Company.Different plant communities identified are: clear forests, gallery forests, shrubby savannas and a mosaic of wooded/tree savannas. The inventory of woody species carried out on circular plots, allowed to identify 126 ligneous species distributed in 40 botanical families and 94 genera. Eleven of these species are classified in the IUCN Red List with the status of “extinction risk”.The pressures on the biodiversity of Djamde’s reserve include poaching, wood fuel production and vegetation fires. Aim of this project is to create an Ecological Corridor between Wildlife Reserve and Sarakawa’s Park and to promote public-private partnership in protected area management.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2019-05-23</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-018</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2019-018</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 18 (2019); 18</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-018/835</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2019-018/836</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-018/1340</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-018/1341</dc:relation><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/downloadSuppFile/dsj-2019-018/1342</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-018</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.5334/dsj-2019-018</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Kozah prefecture (Kara region in northern Togo) - Togo, West Africa</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">May 5, 2014 - May 20, 2018</dc:coverage><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\">Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0 License</dc:coverage><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

The Global Roads Open Access Data Set (gROADS), version 1, is a first step in that direction. gROADS relies on data from a wide range of sources and was developed using a range of methods. Traditionally, map development was highly centralized and controlled by government agencies due to the high cost or required expertise and technology. In the past decade, however, high resolution satellite imagery and global positioning system (GPS) technologies have come into wide use, and there has been significant innovation in web services, such that a number of new methods to develop geospatial information have emerged, including automated and semi-automated road extraction from satellite/aerial imagery and crowdsourcing. In this paper we review the data sources, methods, and pros and cons of a range of road data development methods: heads-up digitizing, automated/semi-automated extraction from remote sensing imagery, GPS technology, crowdsourcing, and compiling existing data sets. We also consider the implications for each method in the production of open data.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2014-05-15</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-001</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.2481/dsj.14-001</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 13 (2014); 45-66</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj.14-001/4</dc:relation><dc:relation>10.2481/dsj.14-001</dc:relation><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:coverage xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:rights xml:lang=\"en-US\">Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution License that allows others to share the work with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in this journal.Authors are able to enter into separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive distribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to an institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement of its initial publication in this journal.Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in institutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the submission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier and greater citation of published work.</dc:rights></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n",

There are three main actors called to deal with research data publishing practices: researchers, publishers, and data repositories. This study analyses the solutions offered by generalist scientific data repositories, i.e., repositories supporting the deposition of any type of research data. These repositories cannot make any assumption on the application domain. They are actually called to face with the almost open ended typologies of data used in science. The current practices promoted by such repositories are analysed with respect to eight key aspects of data publishing, i.e., dataset formatting, documentation, licensing, publication costs, validation, availability, discovery and access, and citation. From this analysis it emerges that these repositories implement well consolidated practices and pragmatic solutions for literature repositories. These practices and solutions can not totally meet the needs of management and use of datasets resources, especially in a context where rapid technological changes continuously open new exploitation prospects.</dc:description><dc:publisher xml:lang=\"en-US\">Ubiquity Press</dc:publisher><dc:contributor xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:date>2016-04-26</dc:date><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/article</dc:type><dc:type>info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion</dc:type><dc:type xml:lang=\"en-US\"/><dc:format>application/xml</dc:format><dc:format>application/pdf</dc:format><dc:identifier>https://datascience.codata.org/jms/article/view/dsj-2016-006</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.5334/dsj-2016-006</dc:identifier><dc:source xml:lang=\"en-US\">Data Science Journal; Vol 15 (2016); 6</dc:source><dc:source>1683-1470</dc:source><dc:language>eng</dc:language><dc:relation>info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/</dc:relation></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>\n"
